S01E01,phoebe,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,Sounds like a date to me.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.",8.3

S01E01,monica,And they weren't looking at you before?!,8.3

S01E01,ross,Hi.,8.3
S01E01,joey,"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.",8.3

S01E01,ross,"I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.",8.3
S01E01,monica,No you don't.,8.3
S01E01,ross,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!",8.3
S01E01,joey,And you never knew she was a lesbian...,8.3
S01E01,ross,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?",8.3
S01E01,chandler,Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?,8.3
S01E01,ross,"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \I'll never have grandchildren",8.3
S01E01,ross,Sorry.,8.3
S01E01,joey,"Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!",8.3
S01E01,ross,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",8.3

S01E01,monica,Rachel?!,8.3

S01E01,monica,"This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Hi, sure!",8.3
S01E01,ross,Hi.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.",8.3
S01E01,monica,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!,8.3
S01E01,ross,I'll have whatever Christine is having.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!",8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.",8.3
S01E01,joey,I say push her down the stairs.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",8.3
S01E01,ross,You can see where he'd have trouble.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...",8.3
S01E01,phoebe,bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...,8.3
S01E01,rachel,I'm all better now.,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,I helped!,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!",8.3
S01E01,joey,"What, like there's a rule or something?",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!",8.3
S01E01,joey,Who's Paul?,8.3
S01E01,ross,"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?",8.3
S01E01,ross,He finally asked you out?,8.3
S01E01,monica,Yes!,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Rach, wait, I can cancel...",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?",8.3
S01E01,ross,That'd be good...,8.3
S01E01,monica,Really?,8.3
S01E01,ross,"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!",8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...",8.3
S01E01,ross,A wandering?,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.",8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Hey, Paul!",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Shut up, Joey!",8.3
S01E01,ross,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!",8.3
S01E01,ross,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Yes, and we're very excited about it.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.",8.3
S01E01,ross,"Okay, sure.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?",8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.",8.3
S01E01,phoebe,La-la-la-la...ohhh!,8.3
S01E01,ross,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",8.3
S01E01,joey,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,It's a beautiful thing.,8.3
S01E01,joey,What's this?,8.3
S01E01,chandler,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.,8.3
S01E01,joey,Which goes where?,8.3
S01E01,chandler,I have no idea.,8.3
S01E01,joey,Done with the bookcase!,8.3
S01E01,chandler,All finished!,8.3
S01E01,ross,"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?",8.3
S01E01,ross,You guys.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Oh, God.",8.3
S01E01,joey,You got screwed.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,Oh my God!,8.3
S01E01,monica,Oh my God!,8.3
S01E01,monica,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",8.3
S01E01,monica,-leg?,8.3
S01E01,monica,"You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-",8.3
S01E01,ross,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!,8.3
S01E01,joey,Shut up!,8.3
S01E01,chandler,You must stop!,8.3
S01E01,ross,That only took me an hour.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!",8.3
S01E01,ross,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",8.3
S01E01,joey,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",8.3
S01E01,ross,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",8.3
S01E01,monica,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?,8.3
S01E01,monica,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!,8.3
S01E01,monica,"...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!,8.3
S01E01,ross,"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.",8.3
S01E01,joey,Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here.,8.3
S01E01,ross,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,That is amazing.,8.3
S01E01,joey,Congratulations.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Morning, Paul.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Hello, Paul.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Hi, Paul, is it?",8.3
S01E01,monica,Stop!,8.3
S01E01,monica,We'll talk later.,8.3
S01E01,joey,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Shut up, and put my table back.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Yeah, I'm an actor.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?,8.3
S01E01,joey,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Look, it was a job all right?",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",8.3
S01E01,joey,I will not take this abuse.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"You're right, I'm sorry.  \Once I was a wooden boy",8.3
S01E01,joey,"You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler?",8.3
S01E01,monica,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Oh, yeah.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"Well, it's like that. With feelings.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Oh wow. Are you in trouble.,8.3
S01E01,monica,Big time!,8.3
S01E01,rachel,Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Oh, look, wish me luck!",8.3
S01E01,monica,What for?,8.3
S01E01,rachel,I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?",8.3
S01E01,monica,How do you do that?,8.3
S01E01,monica,You know Paul?,8.3
S01E01,monica,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,8.3
S01E01,joey,Of course it was a line!,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",8.3
S01E01,ross,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,8.3
S01E01,monica,I hate men!  I hate men!,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",8.3
S01E01,monica,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?",8.3
S01E01,joey,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,8.3
S01E01,rachel,Guess what?,8.3
S01E01,ross,You got a job?,8.3
S01E01,rachel,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Oh, how well you know me...",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",8.3
S01E01,monica,How'd you pay for them?,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Uh, credit card.",8.3
S01E01,monica,And who pays for that?,8.3
S01E01,rachel,Um... my... father.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.",8.3
S01E01,monica,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,I know that. That's why I was getting married.,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Thank you.,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",8.3
S01E01,ross,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...,8.3
S01E01,monica,"All right, you ready?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \Hey",8.3
S01E01,monica,"You can, I know you can!",8.3
S01E01,rachel,I don't think so.,8.3
S01E01,ross,"Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!",8.3
S01E01,ross,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...,8.3
S01E01,monica,Rachel!  That was a library card!,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.",8.3
S01E01,monica,Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!,8.3
S01E01,monica,"Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?",8.3
S01E01,ross,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime.",8.3
S01E01,monica,You be okay?,8.3
S01E01,ross,Yeah.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.",8.3
S01E01,ross,"Mmm.  Oh, no-",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Sorry-,8.3
S01E01,ross,"No no no, go-",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-",8.3
S01E01,ross,Split it?,8.3
S01E01,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S01E01,ross,"Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,I knew.,8.3
S01E01,ross,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,I did.,8.3
S01E01,ross,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Yeah, maybe...",8.3
S01E01,ross,"Okay... okay, maybe I will...",8.3
S01E01,rachel,Goodnight.,8.3
S01E01,ross,Goodnight.,8.3
S01E01,monica,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?",8.3
S01E01,ross,I just grabbed a spoon.,8.3
S01E01,joey,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,I can't believe what I'm hearing here...,8.3
S01E01,monica,What? I-I said you had a-,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,What I said you had...,8.3
S01E01,monica,Would you stop?,8.3
S01E01,phoebe,"Oh, was I doing it again?",8.3
S01E01,monica,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.",8.3
S01E01,joey,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.",8.3
S01E01,ross,There's an image.,8.3
S01E01,rachel,Would anybody like more coffee?,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?",8.3
S01E01,rachel,I'm just serving it.,8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.",8.3
S01E01,rachel,"Ugh.  Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.",8.3
S01E01,chandler,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-",8.3
S01E02,monica,"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.",8.1
S01E02,joey,"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"Oh, yeah!",8.1
S01E02,rachel,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,8.1
S01E02,monica,Absolutely.,8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",8.1
S01E02,chandler,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",8.1
S01E02,joey,....Are we still talking about sex?,8.1
S01E02,ross,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",8.1
S01E02,ross,Does she.,8.1
S01E02,ross,"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?",8.1
S01E02,ross,No. No.,8.1
S01E02,ross,"Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"You look great. I, uh... I hate that.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Why- why are you here, Carol?",8.1
S01E02,ross,Pregnant?!,8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.",8.1
S01E02,monica,Are you through with that?,8.1
S01E02,joey,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.",8.1
S01E02,monica,Whose little ball of paper is this?!,8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!",8.1
S01E02,monica,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.",8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.",8.1
S01E02,joey,"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",8.1
S01E02,monica,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.",8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!",8.1
S01E02,monica,What?,8.1
S01E02,chandler,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!,8.1

S01E02,rachel,"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"No, look, don't touch that!",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...",8.1
S01E02,monica,"Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!",8.1
S01E02,joey,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,8.1
S01E02,chandler,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...",8.1
S01E02,chandler,...Dinah?,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Ohhhhh, don't be mad...",8.1

S01E02,rachel,"Oh, I am sorry...",8.1
S01E02,monica,I gave you one job!,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!",8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...",8.1
S01E02,monica,I just... can't do it.,8.1
S01E02,chandler,Boys? We're going in.,8.1
S01E02,ross,.....Hi.,8.1
S01E02,monica,Wow. That is not a happy hi.,8.1

S01E02,monica,W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...,8.1
S01E02,ross,"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.",8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,She is so great! I miss her.,8.1
S01E02,monica,What does she mean by 'involved'?,8.1
S01E02,chandler,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.",8.1
S01E02,rachel,So what are you gonna do?,8.1
S01E02,ross,"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.",8.1
S01E02,joey,".....Well, this is still ruined, right?",8.1
S01E02,monica,Curry.,8.1
S01E02,ross,"I- I think they're great! I, I really do.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Aw, Mom...",8.1
S01E02,monica,"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?",8.1
S01E02,monica,"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.",8.1
S01E02,monica,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?",8.1
S01E02,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S01E02,monica,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",8.1
S01E02,monica,What's that supposed to mean?,8.1
S01E02,monica,No it's not.,8.1
S01E02,monica,"No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.",8.1
S01E02,joey,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.",8.1
S01E02,monica,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.",8.1
S01E02,ross,Must pee.,8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.",8.1
S01E02,rachel,You're twins?,8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.",8.1
S01E02,chandler,What does she do?,8.1
S01E02,phoebe,She's a waitress.,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.",8.1
S01E02,monica,"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.",8.1
S01E02,chandler,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"The lights, please..",8.1
S01E02,ross,...How long was I in there?,8.1
S01E02,rachel,I'm just cleaning up.,8.1
S01E02,ross,D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!",8.1

S01E02,ross,Mm-hmm..,8.1
S01E02,rachel,A lot.,8.1
S01E02,ross,Mm.,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?",8.1
S01E02,ross,Got me.,8.1
S01E02,rachel,Remember when we were in high school together?,8.1
S01E02,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Yes, yes!",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..",8.1
S01E02,ross,Me either...,8.1
S01E02,ross,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.",8.1
S01E02,ross,How could I forget?,8.1
S01E02,ross,"Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",8.1
S01E02,ross,..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-,8.1
S01E02,ross,"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?",8.1

S01E02,ross,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?",8.1
S01E02,ross,Marlon?!,8.1
S01E02,ross,...As in Mouse?,8.1
S01E02,ross,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Oh, not much. I-I got a job.",8.1
S01E02,rachel,Why are- why are you so tanned?,8.1
S01E02,rachel,Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!",8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!",8.1
S01E02,rachel,And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!,8.1
S01E02,rachel,Okay..,8.1
S01E02,rachel,Wow.,8.1
S01E02,rachel,What?,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.",8.1
S01E02,ross,Helen Geller? I don't think so.,8.1
S01E02,ross,Thank you!,8.1
S01E02,ross,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-",8.1
S01E02,ross,"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.",8.1
S01E02,ross,Oh my God.,8.1
S01E02,ross,Well? Isn't that amazing?,8.1
S01E02,joey,What are we supposed to be seeing here?,8.1
S01E02,chandler,"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.",8.1
S01E02,ross,"Then don't do that, alright?",8.1
S01E02,phoebe,Okay!,8.1
S01E02,ross,Monica. Whaddya think?,8.1
S01E02,monica,Mm-hmm.,8.1
S01E02,ross,Wh- are you welling up?,8.1
S01E02,monica,No.,8.1
S01E02,ross,"You are, you're welling up.",8.1
S01E02,monica,Am not!,8.1
S01E02,ross,You're gonna be an aunt.,8.1
S01E02,monica,Oh shut up!,8.1
S01E02,rachel,"Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.",8.1
S01E03,phoebe,Hi guys!,8.2
S01E03,ross,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'",8.2
S01E03,rachel,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?",8.2
S01E03,monica,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.",8.2
S01E03,rachel,Since when?,8.2
S01E03,joey,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",8.2
S01E03,rachel,And everybody knows this?,8.2
S01E03,joey,Yeah. Cushions the blow.,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",8.2
S01E03,ross,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.",8.2
S01E03,monica,"Uh, Ross.",8.2
S01E03,ross,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!",8.2
S01E03,chandler,"\So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?\""",8.2
S01E03,joey,\Warden,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Hey, that was really good!",8.2
S01E03,joey,Thanks! Let's keep going.,8.2
S01E03,chandler,Okay. \So. Whaddya want from me,8.2
S01E03,joey,\I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"\Smoke away.\""",8.2
S01E03,chandler,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,8.2
S01E03,joey,What?,8.2
S01E03,chandler,Relax your hand!,8.2
S01E03,chandler,Not so much!,8.2
S01E03,joey,Whoah!,8.2
S01E03,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S01E03,joey,Hey!,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Alright, now try taking a puff.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.,8.2
S01E03,joey,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.",8.2
S01E03,joey,Y'miss it?,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.",8.2
S01E03,monica,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",8.2
S01E03,joey,That's ridiculous!,8.2
S01E03,ross,Can I use.. either thumb?,8.2
S01E03,rachel,Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!,8.2
S01E03,rachel,Good for me!,8.2
S01E03,joey,"Y'okay, Phoebe?",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.",8.2
S01E03,monica,What did they do to you?,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-",8.2
S01E03,ross,Easy.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.",8.2
S01E03,joey,What are you talking about? Keep it!,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.",8.2
S01E03,rachel,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...",8.2
S01E03,monica,We're with you. We got it.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.,8.2
S01E03,rachel,"Chandler, what are you doing?",8.2
S01E03,monica,Hey. Whaddya doing?,8.2
S01E03,ross,What is this?!,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!",8.2
S01E03,chandler,And this- is my reward!,8.2
S01E03,ross,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!",8.2
S01E03,chandler,"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!",8.2
S01E03,monica,"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.",8.2
S01E03,rachel,This Alan again? How's it goin'?,8.2
S01E03,monica,"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.",8.2
S01E03,joey,So when do we get to meet the guy?,8.2
S01E03,monica,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never.",8.2
S01E03,monica,No. Not after what happened with Steve.,8.2
S01E03,chandler,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.,8.2
S01E03,monica,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.",8.2
S01E03,rachel,"Well, then can we meet him?",8.2
S01E03,monica,Nope. Schhorry.,8.2
S01E03,monica,"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.",8.2
S01E03,monica,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",8.2
S01E03,joey,"Let it go, Ross.",8.2
S01E03,ross,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.",8.2
S01E03,monica,Do you all promise?,8.2
S01E03,monica,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?,8.2
S01E03,joey,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!",8.2
S01E03,ross,"Hey, Pheebs.",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!",8.2
S01E03,rachel,What bank is this?,8.2

S01E03,joey,Chandler! He's here!,8.2
S01E03,monica,"Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.",8.2
S01E03,monica,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.",8.2
S01E03,monica,"Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?",8.2
S01E03,monica,C'mon!,8.2
S01E03,ross,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.",8.2
S01E03,monica,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?,8.2
S01E03,rachel,And did you notice...?,8.2
S01E03,joey,Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!",8.2
S01E03,ross,...What shoe?,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",8.2
S01E03,ross,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.,8.2
S01E03,rachel,"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.",8.2
S01E03,monica,Really!,8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?",8.2
S01E03,ross,"You know what I like most about him, though?",8.2
S01E03,ross,The way he makes me feel about myself.,8.2
S01E03,monica,Hi.. how was the game?,8.2
S01E03,ross,Well..,8.2
S01E03,joey,Alan.,8.2
S01E03,ross,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...",8.2
S01E03,rachel,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",8.2
S01E03,monica,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,8.2
S01E03,ross,What?,8.2
S01E03,monica,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",8.2
S01E03,rachel,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",8.2
S01E03,ross,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",8.2
S01E03,chandler,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Hey, Lizzie.",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,I brought you alphabet soup.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, \sometimes y\"". Uh",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,I know.,8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.",8.2
S01E03,phoebe,"Oh, that's fine, no.",8.2

S01E04,joey,"Oh, ah- the kid has it.",8.1
S01E04,ross,"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.",8.1
S01E04,chandler,"You gotta do it, man.",8.1
S01E04,ross,"Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",8.1
S01E04,ross,"'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!",8.1
S01E04,ross,NA,8.1
S01E04,ross,...Now that was fun.,8.1
S01E04,monica,"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.",8.1
S01E04,chandler,Thanks.,8.1
S01E04,chandler,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.",8.1
S01E04,rachel,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?",8.1
S01E04,chandler,"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.",8.1
S01E04,rachel,"Nooo!  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.",8.1
S01E04,ross,Green. To the green.,8.1
S01E04,rachel,Never-never mind.,8.1
S01E04,chandler,"To the left, to the left- aww!",8.1
S01E04,rachel,Ohhh... I'm fine.,8.1
S01E05,monica,Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.",8.5
S01E05,ross,Multiple orgasms!,8.5
S01E05,chandler,"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!",8.5
S01E05,joey,"No plans, huh?",8.5
S01E05,chandler,Not a one.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh, right, right, shut up.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.",8.5
S01E05,ross,Tony?,8.5
S01E05,monica,"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Does anybody want anything else?,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?,8.5
S01E05,rachel,It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"That guy, he burns me up.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Did he give you that whole \You're-not-up-to-this\"" thing again?""",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \You'll never make it on your own\"".""",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"My god, Angela.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,Are you gonna go over there?,8.5
S01E05,joey,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.",8.5
S01E05,joey,You look good.,8.5
S01E05,joey,You don't say.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Who?,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Sure.,8.5
S01E05,joey,Bob? Who the hell's Bob?,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.",8.5
S01E05,joey,What?,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?",8.5
S01E05,joey,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.",8.5
S01E05,monica,Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Oh, god help us.",8.5
S01E05,joey,What?,8.5
S01E05,monica,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",8.5
S01E05,monica,What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.,8.5
S01E05,joey,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",8.5
S01E05,ross,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.",8.5
S01E05,ross,Nuh-uh.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,Yuh-huh.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?",8.5
S01E05,ross,No.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,There you go.,8.5
S01E05,monica,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?,8.5
S01E05,joey,Yep.,8.5
S01E05,monica,Which?,8.5
S01E05,joey,Which what?,8.5
S01E05,monica,"You've never met Bob, have you?",8.5
S01E05,joey,"No, but he's...",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...",8.5
S01E05,monica,...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,Where are they? Where are they?,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Eww, I don't wanna do that.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,Here we go.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Ok, have a good break-up.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Hey, Janice.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?",8.5
S01E05,chandler,What?,8.5
S01E05,chandler,What... did you get me there?,8.5
S01E05,chandler,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,That's great.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?",8.5
S01E05,chandler,That's it?,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Yeah, it was really hard.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Ok, you weren't there.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,8.5
S01E05,rachel,What?,8.5
S01E05,ross,What's goin' on?,8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.",8.5
S01E05,ross,Was your basket on top?,8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Yeah, but, there were no suds.",8.5
S01E05,ross,So?,8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Well, you know, no suds, no save.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Ok, let's do laundry.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,What's that?,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Rach, have you never done this before?",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"So, where did you guys grow up?",8.5
S01E05,monica,"How, how did that happen?",8.5
S01E05,joey,Oh my god.,8.5
S01E05,monica,What?,8.5
S01E05,joey,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,8.5
S01E05,joey,"So, you and Angela, huh?",8.5
S01E05,joey,"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.",8.5
S01E05,monica,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  Uh-oh.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,What uh-oh?,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Ross, what's the matter?",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Come on, show me.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh, everything's pink.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",8.5
S01E05,monica,Oh my god.,8.5
S01E05,joey,What?,8.5
S01E05,monica,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Come on, they're close.",8.5
S01E05,monica,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?",8.5
S01E05,joey,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",8.5
S01E05,monica,Oh!,8.5
S01E05,joey,Ow!,8.5
S01E05,monica,I'm outta here.,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",8.5
S01E05,monica,Really?,8.5
S01E05,joey,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",8.5
S01E05,joey,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?",8.5
S01E05,chandler,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?,8.5
S01E05,chandler,"Oh, I don't know, a million?",8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,I'm fine.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,All right.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,I'm not fine. Here she comes.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,Wait here. Breathe.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,How do you do that?,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,It's like a gift.,8.5
S01E05,chandler,We should always always break up together.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Oh, I'd like that.",8.5
S01E05,ross,You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!",8.5
S01E05,rachel,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Yes! Did you see that?,8.5
S01E05,ross,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,I could not have done this without you.,8.5
S01E05,ross,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Are you sure?,8.5
S01E05,ross,No.,8.5
S01E05,rachel,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?",8.5
S01E05,ross,Yeah.,8.5
S01E05,rachel,Does it still hurt?,8.5
S01E05,ross,Yeah.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.,8.5
S01E05,monica,Hi.,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Hey, how'd it go?",8.5
S01E05,joey,Excellent.,8.5
S01E05,monica,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.",8.5
S01E05,ross,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.",8.5
S01E05,monica,"Oh, I'm sorry.",8.5
S01E05,rachel,Where's Chandler?,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve.",8.5
S01E05,chandler,I'm free! I'm free!,8.5
S01E05,phoebe,That oughta do it.,8.5
S01E06,rachel,"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!",8.1
S01E06,ross,"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.",8.1
S01E06,joey,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.",8.1
S01E06,rachel,God. I feel violated.,8.1
S01E06,monica,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Ross, ten o'clock.",8.1
S01E06,ross,Is it? Feels like two.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"No, ten o'clock.",8.1
S01E06,ross,What?,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",8.1
S01E06,ross,Oh. Hel-lo!,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'",8.1
S01E06,rachel,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.",8.1
S01E06,ross,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Thank you, buddy.",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",8.1
S01E06,monica,You could do that!,8.1
S01E06,chandler,Y'think?,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...",8.1

S01E06,chandler,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.",8.1
S01E06,joey,Whadja think?,8.1
S01E06,joey,"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,NA,8.1
S01E06,rachel,What is it?,8.1
S01E06,joey,"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,Based on this play? ...Based on this play!,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Hey, kids.",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.,8.1

S01E06,chandler,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,...Hm.,8.1
S01E06,monica,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?,8.1
S01E06,monica,"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?",8.1
S01E06,ross,"No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.",8.1
S01E06,monica,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?,8.1
S01E06,joey,I couldn't do it.,8.1
S01E06,monica,"Good for you, Joey.",8.1
S01E06,joey,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.",8.1
S01E06,ross,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",8.1
S01E06,ross,"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",8.1
S01E06,monica,"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!",8.1
S01E06,ross,"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",8.1
S01E06,rachel,Tah-daaah!,8.1
S01E06,chandler,Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.,8.1
S01E06,rachel,"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.",8.1
S01E06,ross,"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.",8.1
S01E06,rachel,"Well, whaddya think?",8.1
S01E06,monica,...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.,8.1
S01E06,monica,How-how did that happen?,8.1
S01E06,rachel,"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.",8.1
S01E06,monica,"You guys, I am not that bad!",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!",8.1
S01E06,monica,That is so unfair!,8.1
S01E06,ross,"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.",8.1
S01E06,ross,"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",8.1
S01E06,monica,Why not?,8.1
S01E06,ross,Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.,8.1
S01E06,monica,I could do that.,8.1
S01E06,rachel,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",8.1
S01E06,monica,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",8.1
S01E06,monica,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?,8.1
S01E06,ross,Monica? You're Mom.,8.1
S01E06,phoebe,Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!,8.1
S01E06,joey,My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!,8.1

S01E06,joey,"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! \I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!\""",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"Seriously, what-what's the part?",8.1

S01E06,ross,"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?",8.1
S01E06,joey,...I'm his,8.1
S01E06,rachel,"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?",8.1
S01E06,joey,"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",8.1
S01E06,monica,Oh my God.,8.1
S01E06,joey,"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.",8.1
S01E06,joey,"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",8.1
S01E06,ross,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Alright, alright, alright...",8.1
S01E06,joey,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.,8.1

S01E06,chandler,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.,8.1
S01E06,monica,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!",8.1
S01E06,monica,I warned you...,8.1
S01E06,rachel,Who is being loud?,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..",8.1
S01E06,rachel,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.",8.1
S01E06,joey,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.",8.1
S01E06,joey,Me?,8.1
S01E06,joey,Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.,8.1
S01E06,joey,"Well, I'm- I'm showering.",8.1
S01E06,joey,"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.",8.1
S01E06,joey,I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"God, I love these fingers...",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..",8.1
S01E06,chandler,Don't go.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Too bad, she's leaving.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,You.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Nono, just you.",8.1
S01E06,chandler,Lose the other guys.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...",8.1
S01E06,chandler,...The second guy.,8.1
S01E06,chandler,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.",8.1
S01E06,monica,"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?",8.1
S01E06,joey,Nope.,8.1
S01E06,ross,"No? What happened, big guy?",8.1
S01E06,chandler,"\Big guy?\""",8.1
S01E06,ross,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.,8.1
S01E06,joey,I got fired.,8.1

S01E06,joey,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!",8.1
S01E06,monica,Maybe this wasn't your shot.,8.1
S01E06,ross,"Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?",8.1
S01E06,joey,"Hard to tell, I was naked.",8.1
S01E06,phoebe,"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.",8.1
S01E06,joey,Yeah? That's so nice!,8.1
S01E06,monica,"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.",8.1
S01E06,rachel,"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?",8.1
S01E06,monica,Uh-huh!,8.1

S01E07,ross,Step back.,9
S01E07,joey,We have a winner!,9
S01E07,rachel,"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.",9
S01E07,ross,"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.",9
S01E07,rachel,"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.",9
S01E07,ross,Come on.,9
S01E07,rachel,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.",9
S01E07,ross,And you didn't marry him because...?,9
S01E07,rachel,"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...",9
S01E07,ross,"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.",9
S01E07,rachel,Yeah right.,9
S01E07,ross,"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.",9
S01E07,rachel,OK.,9
S01E07,ross,"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.",9
S01E07,rachel,You don't.,9
S01E07,ross,"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.",9

S01E07,ross,What?,9
S01E07,joey,You and Rachel.,9
S01E07,ross,Why not?,9
S01E07,joey,"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.",9
S01E07,ross,"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.",9
S01E07,joey,"Ross, you're mayor of the zone.",9
S01E07,ross,"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...",9
S01E07,joey,"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.",9
S01E07,ross,"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?",9
S01E07,joey,"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'",9
S01E07,ross,Shhhh!,9
S01E07,rachel,What are you shushing?,9
S01E07,ross,We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?,9
S01E07,rachel,Ahhhh!,9
S01E07,ross,See?,9

S01E07,joey,"Hey, where are you going?",9
S01E07,monica,Outside.,9
S01E07,joey,You can't go out there.,9
S01E07,monica,Why not?,9
S01E07,joey,Because of... the reason.,9
S01E07,monica,And that would be?,9
S01E07,joey,"I, um, can't tell you.",9
S01E07,monica,"Joey, what's going on?",9
S01E07,joey,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.",9
S01E07,monica,About what?,9
S01E07,joey,He's planning your birthday party.,9
S01E07,monica,Oh my God! I love him!,9
S01E07,joey,You'd better act surprised.,9
S01E07,phoebe,About what?,9
S01E07,monica,My surprise party!,9
S01E07,phoebe,What surprise party?,9
S01E07,monica,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.,9
S01E07,phoebe,"Well, he didn't tell me.",9
S01E07,joey,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.",9
S01E07,phoebe,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,9
S01E07,monica,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",9
S01E07,phoebe,Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.,9
S01E07,rachel,Hmmm... this is so nice.,9
S01E07,ross,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",9
S01E07,rachel,OK.,9
S01E07,ross,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",9
S01E07,rachel,Ohhh!!!!,9

S01E07,rachel,"Oh, look at the little cat!",9
S01E07,ross,What?  Ow!,9
S01E07,monica,This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,9
S01E07,joey,"Sorry, that was wax.",9
S01E07,phoebe,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",9
S01E07,ross,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?,9
S01E07,rachel,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,9
S01E07,ross,Yeah?,9
S01E07,chandler,"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.",9
S01E07,phoebe,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?",9
S01E07,rachel,Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.,9
S01E07,phoebe,He seems to hate you. Are you sure?,9
S01E07,phoebe,Wait a minute. What's his name?,9
S01E07,rachel,Bob Buttons?,9
S01E07,phoebe,Oooh! You are a very bad man!,9

S01E07,monica,Hi!,9
S01E07,rachel,He doesn't speak much English.,9
S01E07,rachel,Look at that!,9
S01E07,ross,"So, um... where did Paolo come from?",9
S01E07,rachel,"Oh... Italy, I think.",9
S01E07,ross,"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",9
S01E07,rachel,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",9
S01E07,ross,"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",9
S01E07,phoebe,Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,9
S01E07,rachel,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",9
S01E07,phoebe,Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,9
S01E07,rachel,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",9
S01E07,phoebe,You betcha!,9
S01E07,chandler,"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.",9
S01E07,chandler,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.",9
S01E07,chandler,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.",9
S01E07,chandler,Yes... thank you. That was... that was....,9
S01E07,ross,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....",9
S01E07,ross,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?,9
S01E07,rachel,I have absolutely no idea.,9
S01E07,ross,That's... that's classic.,9
S01E07,rachel,"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!",9
S01E07,monica,"If you want, I'll do it.",9
S01E07,phoebe,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.",9
S01E07,rachel,"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.",9
S01E07,phoebe,"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.",9
S01E07,rachel,"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....",9
S01E07,ross,Paolo. Hi.,9
S01E07,ross,"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.",9
S01E07,ross,"Thing, yes. Thing.",9
S01E07,ross,"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...",9
S01E07,ross,"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.",9
S01E07,ross,Yeah! Se vice?,9
S01E07,ross,So you do know a little English.,9
S01E07,ross,Do you know the word crapweasel?,9
S01E07,ross,"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!",9
S01E07,chandler,OK.,9
S01E07,phoebe,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...",9
S01E07,ross,Thank you.,9
S01E07,phoebe,Thanks.,9
S01E07,ross,Kinda... spooky without any lights.,9
S01E07,joey,Bwah-hah-hah!,9
S01E07,ross,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...",9
S01E07,ross,Oh.. oh... oh.,9
S01E07,joey,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",9
S01E07,chandler,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.",9
S01E07,chandler,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.",9
S01E08,chandler,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...",8.1
S01E08,chandler,Yes please.,8.1
S01E08,chandler,He's a he?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...",8.1
S01E08,chandler,You did?,8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?",8.1
S01E08,monica,I did.,8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Yeah, I think so, yeah.",8.1
S01E08,joey,Not me.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?,8.1
S01E08,ross,"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",8.1
S01E08,chandler,WHAT IS IT?!,8.1
S01E08,monica,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.",8.1
S01E08,monica,"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio.",8.1
S01E08,ross,So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.,8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.",8.1
S01E08,monica,"Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"So, uh, how's she doing?",8.1
S01E08,monica,"How-how are you, Mom?",8.1
S01E08,monica,What?,8.1
S01E08,monica,Nothing.,8.1
S01E08,monica,"She is unbelievable, our mother is...",8.1
S01E08,ross,"Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.",8.1
S01E08,monica,Oh God!,8.1
S01E08,monica,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.",8.1
S01E08,ross,She looks so small.,8.1
S01E08,monica,I know.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.",8.1
S01E08,monica,"G'bye, Nana.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"Bye, Nana.",8.1
S01E08,monica,Ross!,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..",8.1
S01E08,ross,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"I, uh, I'll go see.",8.1
S01E08,ross,Now she's passed.,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair.",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"So, um, did she...",8.1
S01E08,ross,Twice.,8.1
S01E08,joey,Twice?,8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Oh, that sucks!",8.1
S01E08,joey,You guys okay?,8.1
S01E08,ross,"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Nono, she's gone.",8.1
S01E08,monica,We checked. A lot.,8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,Thanks!,8.1
S01E08,rachel,Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.,8.1
S01E08,joey,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.",8.1
S01E08,ross,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,8.1
S01E08,ross,I don't see why not.,8.1
S01E08,ross,Here's my retainer!,8.1
S01E08,monica,Dad!,8.1
S01E08,monica,You what?,8.1
S01E08,monica,Define fun.,8.1
S01E08,monica,"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.",8.1
S01E08,monica,That's probably what they'll say.,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Hey, gorgeous.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"...Quality, right, great.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,8.1
S01E08,ross,This one?,8.1
S01E08,ross,"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.",8.1
S01E08,ross,Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Okay. Um, how about these?",8.1
S01E08,ross,And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",8.1
S01E08,ross,Oh my God..,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"How we doing, you guys ready?",8.1
S01E08,monica,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,8.1
S01E08,ross,Some days it's all I can think about.,8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,What'd I say?,8.1
S01E08,rachel,Hm-m.,8.1
S01E08,monica,Are these the shoes?,8.1
S01E08,rachel,Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?",8.1
S01E08,joey,Morning. We ready to go?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?",8.1
S01E08,monica,It was a really beautiful service.,8.1
S01E08,joey,What?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.",8.1
S01E08,joey,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,You're watching a football game at a funeral?,8.1
S01E08,joey,"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"You are a frightening, frightening man.",8.1
S01E08,rachel,Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!,8.1
S01E08,ross,"Oh, I hope they're not ruined.",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!",8.1
S01E08,ross,"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-",8.1
S01E08,ross,I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...,8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"What, what is it?",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,You missed a belt loop.,8.1
S01E08,ross,Oh! No-n-,8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Okay, it's in spasm.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Oh, no-",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?",8.1
S01E08,ross,"I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.",8.1
S01E08,monica,"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?",8.1
S01E08,ross,"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister",8.1
S01E08,phoebe,Ooh! That's so nice...,8.1
S01E08,ross,...Chandler!,8.1
S01E08,chandler,Hey.,8.1
S01E08,ross,"And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.",8.1
S01E08,ross,Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.,8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Oh, well you know who I love the most?",8.1
S01E08,ross,No.,8.1
S01E08,rachel,You!,8.1
S01E08,ross,Oh.. you don't get it!,8.1
S01E08,joey,"Just a, uh... hearing disability.",8.1
S01E08,joey,Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.,8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?",8.1
S01E08,monica,"Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.",8.1
S01E08,monica,That sounds like Nana.,8.1
S01E08,monica,...I can imagine.,8.1
S01E08,monica,"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?",8.1
S01E08,monica,"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.",8.1
S01E08,monica,Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?,8.1
S01E08,monica,Huh.,8.1
S01E08,monica,"Oh, I think so.",8.1
S01E08,monica,Thank you. They're yours.,8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?",8.1
S01E08,ross,That little naked guy would be me.,8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Aww, look at the little thing.",8.1
S01E08,ross,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",8.1
S01E08,chandler,Who are those people?,8.1
S01E08,ross,Got me.,8.1
S01E08,monica,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.",8.1
S01E08,rachel,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",8.1
S01E08,monica,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",8.1
S01E08,ross,Looks like a fun gang.,8.1
S01E08,joey,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!",8.1
S01E08,ross,"Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Hey, Lowell.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,So how's it going there in Financial Services?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.",8.1
S01E08,chandler,Really.,8.1
S01E08,chandler,So- you can tell?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?",8.1
S01E08,chandler,He is?,8.1
S01E08,chandler,"Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian.",8.1
S01E09,rachel,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"No, they're not.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.",8.2
S01E09,ross,You're wrong.,8.2
S01E09,monica,I am not wrong.,8.2
S01E09,ross,You're wrong.,8.2
S01E09,monica,"No, I just talked to them.",8.2
S01E09,ross,I'm calling Mom.,8.2
S01E09,joey,"Hey, hey.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,Hey.,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,Hey.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?,8.2
S01E09,joey,"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,What were you modeling for?,8.2
S01E09,joey,You know those posters for the city free clinic?,8.2
S01E09,monica,"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those \healthy",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,Do you know which one you're gonna be?,8.2
S01E09,joey,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it.",8.2
S01E09,joey,Thanks.,8.2
S01E09,ross,"Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.",8.2
S01E09,ross,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?,8.2
S01E09,monica,"You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?",8.2
S01E09,joey,Yeah.,8.2
S01E09,monica,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Yes, every single one of them.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"So you're free Thursday, then.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Yeah. Oh, can I come?",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,I thought it was $98.50.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Well, I'm off to Carol's.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",8.2
S01E09,ross,Kinda like a big face without skin.,8.2
S01E09,ross,"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",8.2
S01E09,ross,Really?,8.2
S01E09,ross,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Rach, here's your mail.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"No, here's your mail.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Would you just open it?,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",8.2
S01E09,monica,We all chipped in.,8.2
S01E09,joey,We did?,8.2
S01E09,monica,You owe me 20 bucks.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,Thank you. Thank you so much!,8.2
S01E09,monica,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"All right, I'm nine years old.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Oh, I hate this story.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,Oh my god.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,8.2
S01E09,joey,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?",8.2
S01E09,joey,I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.,8.2
S01E09,joey,"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?",8.2
S01E09,joey,What's wrong?,8.2
S01E09,joey,Oh. What?,8.2
S01E09,joey,"Wait, wait, wait!",8.2
S01E09,joey,So I guess you all saw it.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,Saw what?,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.",8.2
S01E09,joey,Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?",8.2
S01E09,ross,I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.,8.2
S01E09,monica,"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.",8.2
S01E09,ross,That's closer.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Oh, you must stop shooping.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Chandler, will you just come in already?",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",8.2
S01E09,monica,That's not a question.,8.2
S01E09,joey,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Ah!,8.2
S01E09,ross,"Ok, Mom never hit.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Ok, all done.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Why would we do that?,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!",8.2
S01E09,chandler,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,8.2
S01E09,joey,The balloon?,8.2
S01E09,chandler,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"I can't, I gotta go.",8.2
S01E09,chandler,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,Almost never.,8.2
S01E09,monica,Got the keys? or Got the keys!,8.2
S01E09,rachel,Ok.,8.2
S01E09,ross,"Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",8.2
S01E09,rachel,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,8.2
S01E09,monica,No I don't.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, \got the keys.\""",8.2
S01E09,monica,"No I didn't. I asked, \got the ke-eys?\""",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"No, no, no, you said, \got the keys\"".""",8.2
S01E09,chandler,Do either of you have the keys?,8.2
S01E09,monica,The oven is on.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Well then get it, get it!",8.2
S01E09,joey,That tone will not make me go any faster.,8.2
S01E09,monica,Joey!,8.2
S01E09,joey,That one will.,8.2
S01E09,ross,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Shh!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Does it always, uh--?",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Nope, not that one.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Can you go any faster with that?,8.2
S01E09,joey,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,8.2
S01E09,chandler,For an emergency just like this.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,right now. But I'm not.,8.2
S01E09,monica,I swear you said you had the keys.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Why would I have the keys?,8.2
S01E09,rachel,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,8.2
S01E09,monica,But I didn't.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Well, you should have.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Why?,8.2
S01E09,rachel,Because!,8.2
S01E09,monica,Why?,8.2
S01E09,rachel,Because!,8.2
S01E09,monica,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.",8.2
S01E09,joey,"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.",8.2
S01E09,monica,"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?",8.2
S01E09,joey,You call that delicious?,8.2
S01E09,monica,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!",8.2
S01E09,chandler,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,Ooh.,8.2
S01E09,rachel,What?,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.,8.2
S01E09,joey,I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!,8.2
S01E09,monica,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,It's nice that he has someone.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,Shall I carve?,8.2
S01E09,rachel,By all means.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?",8.2
S01E09,ross,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.,8.2
S01E09,monica,Does anybody wanna split this with me?,8.2
S01E09,joey,"Oh, I will.",8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.",8.2
S01E09,monica,Make a wish?,8.2
S01E09,phoebe,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",8.2
S01E09,joey,The bigger half.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",8.2
S01E09,ross,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",8.2
S01E09,rachel,And a crappy New Year.,8.2
S01E09,chandler,"Here, here!",8.2
S01E10,ross,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.,8.1
S01E10,monica,W-wait. What is that?,8.1
S01E10,ross,'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?,8.1
S01E10,monica,"No, no, I don't.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?",8.1
S01E10,ross,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",8.1
S01E10,monica,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?",8.1
S01E10,ross,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...",8.1
S01E10,monica,Why don't you just get a roommate?,8.1
S01E10,ross,"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,Might wanna open with the snowman.,8.1
S01E10,monica,"So, how'd it go?",8.1
S01E10,joey,"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.",8.1
S01E10,ross,How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.,8.1
S01E10,joey,"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.",8.1
S01E10,monica,So what are you gonna be?,8.1
S01E10,joey,"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Yeah, you wish!",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Phoebe, you're on.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, oh, good.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,NA,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,NA,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,NA,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",8.1
S01E10,chandler,That guy's going home with a note!,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Could you speak up please?,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Okay, we're gonna take a short break.",8.1
S01E10,joey,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!",8.1
S01E10,ross,"Come here, Marcel. Sit here.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?",8.1
S01E10,ross,Just a smidge.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.",8.1
S01E10,monica,I think it's romantic.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,8.1
S01E10,rachel,Yeah!,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.",8.1
S01E10,monica,What?!,8.1
S01E10,ross,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.",8.1
S01E10,monica,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!",8.1
S01E10,joey,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!,8.1
S01E10,joey,"Nice shoes, huh?",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Aah, y'killing me!",8.1
S01E10,monica,Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!,8.1
S01E10,ross,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?",8.1
S01E10,monica,Do you always have to bring him here?,8.1
S01E10,ross,"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",8.1
S01E10,ross,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Sure.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh yeah, right now.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,I can hop.,8.1
S01E10,ross,So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?,8.1
S01E10,monica,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?,8.1
S01E10,monica,Yeah.,8.1
S01E10,joey,You know more than one Fun Bobby?,8.1
S01E10,chandler,I happen to know a Fun Bob.,8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Okay, here we go...",8.1
S01E10,joey,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!",8.1

S01E10,rachel,Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.,8.1
S01E10,joey,"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?",8.1
S01E10,ross,"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.",8.1
S01E10,ross,"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.",8.1
S01E10,monica,What's the matter?,8.1
S01E10,ross,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...",8.1
S01E10,chandler,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.",8.1
S01E10,ross,Really.,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.",8.1
S01E10,ross,"What, uh... what juggling thing?",8.1
S01E10,chandler,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.,8.1
S01E10,ross,No.,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"No, no, he hasn't been around.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Minsk?,8.1

S01E10,phoebe,"So when, when do you leave?",8.1

S01E10,phoebe,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,So-so you're really not going?,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Oh don't do that.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Oh no no.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, but I can't do that-",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"It's your thing, and-",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Okay, um, stay.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Stay.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Getting so good at that!,8.1

S01E10,ross,Par-tay!,8.1
S01E10,monica,That thing is not coming in here.,8.1
S01E10,ross,"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?",8.1
S01E10,monica,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.,8.1
S01E10,ross,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...,8.1
S01E10,monica,Alright. Just keep him away from me.,8.1
S01E10,ross,"Thank you.  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.",8.1
S01E10,monica,"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?",8.1
S01E10,rachel,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,And then... your face is bloated?,8.1
S01E10,rachel,"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?",8.1
S01E10,joey,"Wow, that's, uh, dirty.",8.1
S01E10,joey,"Hey, kids...",8.1
S01E10,ross,"Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,But you found me!,8.1
S01E10,chandler,Kill me. Kill me now.,8.1
S01E10,monica,Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!,8.1
S01E10,joey,Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-",8.1
S01E10,chandler,I'm sorry you misunderstood...,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Oh, will you give me the thing.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Hi, Max!",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Are you alright?,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,You're going to Minsk.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say  'no! No! I can't understand that!'.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.,8.1
S01E10,joey,"There y'go, kids.",8.1
S01E10,chandler,NA,8.1
S01E10,joey,You seen Sandy?,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,The bll is drrbing!,8.1
S01E10,chandler,And the moment of joy is upon us.,8.1
S01E10,joey,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.,8.1
S01E10,phoebe,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.,8.1
S01E10,monica,Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.",8.1
S01E10,phoebe,I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.,8.1
S01E10,rachel,I can't kiss anyone.,8.1
S01E10,monica,So I'm kissing everyone?,8.1
S01E10,joey,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.",8.1
S01E10,ross,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.,8.1
S01E10,chandler,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!",8.1
S01E10,joey,Alrightalrightalright.  There.,8.1
S01E10,ross,"I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.",8.1
S01E10,rachel,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.,8.1
S01E11,phoebe,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?,8.2
S01E11,monica,Why?,8.2
S01E11,phoebe,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.",8.2

S01E12,rachel,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs...",8.2
S01E12,phoebe,The end.,8.2
S01E12,rachel,"Oh, God...",8.2

S01E12,ross,"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.",8.2
S01E12,joey,"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.",8.2
S01E12,ross,"Come on, two on one.",8.2
S01E12,chandler,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!",8.2
S01E12,ross,"What, now?",8.2
S01E12,joey,"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",8.2
S01E12,chandler,"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!",8.2
S01E12,ross,How's it going?,8.2
S01E12,monica,"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, \How could you?\"" or",8.2
S01E12,phoebe,Ooh!,8.2
S01E12,phoebe,"Oh, ok bye-bye.",8.2

S01E12,monica,"Oh, you're right.",8.2
S01E12,ross,...and I really think it should be me.,8.2
S01E12,ross,Hey.,8.2

S01E12,ross,What?,8.2
S01E12,rachel,"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.",8.2

S01E12,phoebe,Yep!,8.2
S01E12,ross,"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.",8.2
S01E12,rachel,"No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want",8.2
S01E12,ross,"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.",8.2
S01E12,rachel,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.",8.2
S01E12,ross,What?,8.2
S01E12,rachel,What?,8.2
S01E12,ross,"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?",8.2

S01E13,chandler,"Rachel, wait, wait.",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!",8.7
S01E13,chandler,Can I just say one thing?,8.7
S01E13,rachel,What? What?!,8.7
S01E13,chandler,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,8.7
S01E13,rachel,Oh!!,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,Oops!,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,Isn't he great?,8.7
S01E13,rachel,He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?",8.7
S01E13,monica,"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.",8.7

S01E13,chandler,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.",8.7
S01E13,ross,You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?,8.7
S01E13,chandler,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.,8.7
S01E13,rachel,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?",8.7
S01E13,chandler,Huh.,8.7

S01E13,joey,You're one to talk.,8.7
S01E13,joey,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.,8.7
S01E13,joey,"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?",8.7
S01E13,chandler,What?,8.7
S01E13,rachel,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?,8.7
S01E13,ross,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.',8.7
S01E13,monica,Hello?,8.7

S01E13,ross,Yeah.,8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",8.7
S01E13,ross,"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.",8.7
S01E13,ross,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?",8.7
S01E13,ross,Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?,8.7
S01E13,monica,"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.",8.7
S01E13,ross,That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!,8.7
S01E13,monica,Oh! So you think I'm a failure!,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,Isn't he good?,8.7
S01E13,ross,"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...",8.7
S01E13,monica,"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!",8.7
S01E13,ross,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.",8.7

S01E13,chandler,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Dad, Ronni's here.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",8.7
S01E13,joey,Who-ah-ho.,8.7
S01E13,joey,No you won't.,8.7
S01E13,joey,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.,8.7
S01E13,joey,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \No thanks",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni",8.7
S01E13,joey,Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!,8.7
S01E13,joey,I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!,8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",8.7
S01E13,joey,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Well, you're gonna.",8.7
S01E13,joey,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",8.7
S01E13,joey,No.,8.7
S01E13,chandler,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \No thanks",8.7
S01E13,joey,You really think so?,8.7
S01E13,chandler,Yeah. I really do.,8.7
S01E13,joey,"Thanks, Chandler.",8.7

S01E13,joey,With this ring?  No contest.,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Nothing, nothing.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,Intense and creepy.,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!",8.7
S01E13,monica,"So you talked to your dad, huh.",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.",8.7
S01E13,rachel,Wow.,8.7
S01E13,chandler,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.,8.7
S01E13,ross,"So Joey, you okay?",8.7
S01E13,joey,"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.",8.7
S01E13,rachel,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.",8.7
S01E13,chandler,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,Hey.,8.7
S01E13,monica,How's it going?,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Yeah, right.",8.7
S01E13,rachel,What happened?,8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!",8.7
S01E13,phoebe,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?",8.7
S01E13,monica,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!,8.7
S01E13,joey,Sorry. Wrong boobies.,8.7
S01E13,monica,"Hello, Joey.",8.7
S01E14,joey,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.",8.3
S01E14,ross,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.,8.3
S01E14,chandler,Any contact?,8.3
S01E14,ross,She lent me an egg once.,8.3
S01E14,joey,You're in!,8.3
S01E14,ross,"Aw, right.",8.3
S01E14,ross,Hey.,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...",8.3
S01E14,joey,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.",8.3
S01E14,ross,An egg?,8.3
S01E14,joey,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, \Here's your egg back",8.3
S01E14,chandler,I think it's winning.,8.3
S01E14,ross,I think it's insane.,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.",8.3
S01E14,joey,Think it'll work?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.",8.3
S01E14,monica,You can not do this.,8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Do what, do what?",8.3
S01E14,monica,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.,8.3
S01E14,rachel,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?,8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!",8.3
S01E14,monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.",8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?",8.3
S01E14,joey,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",8.3
S01E14,joey,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...",8.3
S01E14,joey,"Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.",8.3
S01E14,ross,Hi. She said yes.,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?",8.3
S01E14,joey,How do I look?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,...And what did you bring?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,Janice?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Hey, it's Janice.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.",8.3
S01E14,joey,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!,8.3
S01E14,joey,"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!",8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.",8.3
S01E14,monica,Which one was Pete Carney?,8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  \Was it good for you?\""",8.3
S01E14,monica,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\I-win\""-guy.  \""I win! I win!\"" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.""",8.3
S01E14,rachel,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!,8.3
S01E14,monica,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.,8.3
S01E14,phoebe,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.,8.3
S01E14,monica,"There's more beer, right?",8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.",8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.",8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.",8.3
S01E14,monica,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?",8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.",8.3
S01E14,rachel,Or?,8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.",8.3
S01E14,monica,Burning's good.,8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.",8.3
S01E14,joey,"Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?",8.3
S01E14,chandler,That's OK.,8.3
S01E14,joey,We can't do that.,8.3
S01E14,chandler,What? What can't you do?,8.3
S01E14,joey,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",8.3
S01E14,joey,"Uh, we might be leaving now.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Tell me it's \you and me\"" we.""",8.3
S01E14,joey,"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Ok, you can not do this to me.",8.3
S01E14,joey,"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.",8.3
S01E14,joey,"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,I hope she throws up on you.,8.3
S01E14,chandler,So...,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Oh, what a crappy night!",8.3
S01E14,chandler,Excuse me.  How ya doin'?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...",8.3

S01E14,monica,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call.",8.3
S01E14,ross,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",8.3
S01E14,ross,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.",8.3
S01E14,ross,If you wanna put a label on it.,8.3
S01E14,ross,"Nope, nope, that's it.",8.3
S01E14,ross,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!",8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.",8.3
S01E14,monica,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.",8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.",8.3
S01E14,rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",8.3
S01E14,monica,Can we just start throwing things in?,8.3
S01E14,phoebe,"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.",8.3

S01E14,monica,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...",8.3
S01E14,chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?,8.3
S01E14,joey,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.,8.3

S01E14,chandler,"Hi, Just Janice.",8.3
S01E14,joey,"If you don't do it, I will.",8.3
S01E14,ross,"So, um, what do you do for a living?",8.3
S01E14,ross,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",8.3
S01E14,ross,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,8.3
S01E14,ross,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!",8.3
S01E14,monica,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",8.3
S01E14,rachel,Really?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,It is?,8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"Oh, no I don't.",8.3
S01E14,chandler,"I did, but...",8.3
S01E14,chandler,Call me!,8.3
S01E14,ross,"You did so. I swear, I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?",8.3
S01E14,ross,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.,8.3
S01E14,ross,"Oh, god.",8.3
S01E14,ross,"No, it's just...you know the whole \getting on with your life\"" thing. Well",8.3
S01E14,ross,"No but, no but.",8.3
S01E14,ross,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already.",8.3

S01E15,monica,"Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?",8.2
S01E15,rachel,Yeah?,8.2
S01E15,monica,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?,8.2
S01E15,rachel,Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.",8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...",8.2
S01E15,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,8.2
S01E15,ross,What's going on?,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.",8.2
S01E15,chandler,So.... I quit.,8.2
S01E15,chandler,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!,8.2
S01E15,monica,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.",8.2
S01E15,chandler,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,So was it a lot more money?,8.2
S01E15,chandler,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.,8.2
S01E15,rachel,... the WENUS?,8.2
S01E15,chandler,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.,8.2
S01E15,rachel,Oh. That WENUS.,8.2
S01E15,joey,So what're you going to do?,8.2
S01E15,chandler,I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.",8.2
S01E15,monica,Um... hi there.,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....",8.2
S01E15,chandler,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Yeah, yeah!",8.2
S01E15,monica,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.",8.2
S01E15,monica,Oh my God!,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?",8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what!,8.2
S01E15,chandler,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?,8.2
S01E15,rachel,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?",8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the \a-gogo.\""",8.2
S01E15,rachel,Career counselor?,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",8.2
S01E15,rachel,I don't!,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",8.2
S01E15,ross,"Ah, the lesser-known \I don't have a dream\"" speech.""",8.2
S01E15,monica,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,Ooh! Brian's Song!,8.2
S01E15,rachel,The meeting with the guy went great?,8.2
S01E15,monica,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",8.2
S01E15,chandler,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?,8.2
S01E15,monica,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",8.2
S01E15,rachel,What are you going to make?,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,Yummy noises.,8.2
S01E15,rachel,"And Monica, what are you going to make?",8.2
S01E15,monica,I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,Ooh! I know what you could make!,8.2
S01E15,ross,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?",8.2
S01E15,joey,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.",8.2
S01E15,ross,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?",8.2
S01E15,chandler,Who are you going out with?,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,"Oh, is this the bug lady?",8.2
S01E15,rachel,"Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.",8.2
S01E15,ross,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.,8.2
S01E15,rachel,So what are you guys going to do?,8.2
S01E15,ross,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.",8.2
S01E15,chandler,And he's not speaking metaphorically.,8.2
S01E15,joey,huh-huh?,8.2
S01E15,ross,"Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.",8.2
S01E15,joey,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.",8.2
S01E15,ross,"Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...",8.2
S01E15,ross,Alright...,8.2
S01E15,monica,"OK, try this salmon mousse.",8.2
S01E15,joey,Mmmm. Good.,8.2
S01E15,monica,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,8.2
S01E15,joey,It's creamier.,8.2
S01E15,monica,"Yeah, well, is that better?",8.2
S01E15,joey,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",8.2
S01E15,rachel,My God! What happened to you?,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  \You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.\""",8.2
S01E15,phoebe,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.",8.2
S01E15,rachel,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",8.2
S01E15,monica,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.",8.2
S01E15,chandler,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",8.2
S01E15,monica,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,8.2
S01E15,chandler,Well.... it is amouz-ing...,8.2
S01E15,monica,NA,8.2
S01E15,phoebe,Ten dollars an hour for what?,8.2
S01E15,monica,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.",8.2
S01E15,rachel,Waitressing?,8.2
S01E15,joey,Uh-oh.,8.2
S01E15,monica,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...,8.2
S01E15,rachel,"But, but?",8.2
S01E15,monica,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",8.2
S01E15,rachel,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,8.2
S01E15,chandler,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.",8.2
S01E15,ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...",8.2
S01E15,ross,"Wha... what, here?",8.2
S01E15,ross,Ah....,8.2
S01E15,ross,Er.... um.....,8.2
S01E15,ross,Um... uh.... vulva.,8.2
S01E15,joey,Vulva?,8.2
S01E15,ross,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",8.2
S01E15,joey,Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??,8.2
S01E15,ross,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",8.2
S01E15,joey,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.,8.2
S01E15,ross,Please be kidding.,8.2
S01E15,joey,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.",8.2
S01E15,ross,OK.  I'm in my apartment...,8.2
S01E15,joey,....yeah... what else?,8.2

S01E19,ross,"Yeah. You, uh, you want some?",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-",8.1

S01E19,ross,You called Animal Control?,8.1
S01E19,rachel,Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?,8.1

S01E19,monica,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?",8.1
S01E19,phoebe,"Yes, but there isn't always time!",8.1

S01E19,joey,"We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.",8.1

S01E19,monica,What're you gonna do?,8.1
S01E19,monica,"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!  Are you okay?",8.1
S01E19,phoebe,"Yeah, think so. Oh!  Whoah.",8.1
S01E19,monica,Oh gosh.,8.1
S01E19,ross,Marcel?,8.1
S01E19,rachel,Marcel?,8.1
S01E19,ross,"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Ross, you don't know that.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...",8.1
S01E19,rachel,Ross.,8.1
S01E19,ross,"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...",8.1
S01E19,rachel,Ross.,8.1
S01E19,ross,"Oh, forget it, okay?",8.1
S01E19,rachel,Ross!,8.1
S01E19,ross,What? What?,8.1
S01E19,phoebe,"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Hi, did you order some bananas?",8.1
S01E19,ross,Gimme back my monkey.,8.1
S01E19,rachel,Then what's with all the bananas?,8.1
S01E19,ross,"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?",8.1
S01E19,ross,Marcel! What've you done to him?,8.1
S01E19,ross,"Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"C'mere, Marcel.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Okay, gimme my monkey back.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Alright, I want my monkey.",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!",8.1
S01E19,ross,"You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",8.1
S01E19,ross,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...",8.1
S01E19,rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...",8.1
S01E19,ross,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?",8.1
S01E19,rachel,That'd be good.,8.1
S01E19,ross,"Alright.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...",8.1
S01E19,rachel,Barry?!,8.1
S01E19,ross,We have got to start locking that door!,8.1
S01E19,monica,This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?,8.1
S01E19,phoebe,Nope.,8.1
S01E19,monica,That's because I'm in front of them.,8.1
S01E19,chandler,Eh. I thought that was an alp.,8.1
S01E19,monica,"Well, high school was not my favourite time.",8.1
S01E19,joey,"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.",8.1
S01E19,chandler,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.",8.1
S01E19,monica,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?",8.1
S01E19,phoebe,Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!,8.1
S01E20,chandler,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.,7.9
S01E20,joey,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",7.9
S01E20,ross,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",7.9
S01E20,monica,Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,7.9
S01E20,ross,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Oh, that is so sick.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,I feel violated. And not in a good way.,7.9
S01E20,phoebe,"How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",7.9
S01E20,monica,So have you called her yet?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I'm right, right?",7.9
S01E20,monica,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,7.9
S01E20,phoebe,"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",7.9
S01E20,joey,Her answer machine?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \Yes indeedy-o.\""",7.9
S01E20,monica,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",7.9
S01E20,ross,"Okay, okay, what's going on?",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,"Okay, they're just talking...",7.9
S01E20,ross,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!",7.9
S01E20,ross,What? What? What?!,7.9
S01E20,phoebe,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,Hey Rach!,7.9
S01E20,monica,How'd it go?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,Not a good day for birds...,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",7.9
S01E20,ross,"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",7.9
S01E20,ross,"That's, that's nice twice!",7.9
S01E20,monica,"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?",7.9
S01E20,joey,"Duh, where've you been?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?",7.9
S01E20,chandler,Yes!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Why?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,I have my reasons.,7.9
S01E20,monica,"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!",7.9
S01E20,rachel,Wow... Wow!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",7.9
S01E20,chandler,Oh God!,7.9
S01E20,monica,That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Hey, I've been honing!",7.9
S01E20,ross,What was with the dishes?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",7.9
S01E20,monica,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,Oh my God!  Stop looking in here!,7.9
S01E20,monica,"Great, now he's waving back.",7.9
S01E20,joey,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",7.9
S01E20,monica,What kinda stuff?,7.9
S01E20,joey,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,You cook naked?,7.9
S01E20,joey,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Well, what about Mindy?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..",7.9
S01E20,rachel,I had a bra.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,What?!,7.9
S01E20,chandler,Can I use your phone?,7.9
S01E20,monica,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",7.9
S01E20,joey,Maybe she never got your message.,7.9
S01E20,phoebe,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,7.9
S01E20,ross,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,How many beeps?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,She answered.,7.9
S01E20,monica,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,How'd he take it?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Pretty well, actually...",7.9
S01E20,monica,"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Oh, do I?",7.9
S01E20,monica,Uh huh.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,We ended up having sex in his chair.,7.9
S01E20,monica,"You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?",7.9
S01E20,ross,You-you had what?,7.9
S01E20,phoebe,Sex in his chair.,7.9
S01E20,ross,"What, uh... what were you thinking?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.",7.9
S01E20,ross,"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Please. If she said to you, \Ross",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"If it helps, I could slide over.",7.9
S01E20,ross,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.",7.9
S01E20,phoebe,Where are you going?,7.9
S01E20,ross,"I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?",7.9
S01E20,chandler,Hello? Hello?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.,7.9
S01E20,chandler,So how's Mindy?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry...  Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!",7.9
S01E20,monica,Brrrrrrr!,7.9
S01E20,chandler,Hell is filled with people like you.,7.9
S01E20,joey,He's back! The peeper's back!,7.9
S01E20,joey,Get down!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Get down?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,...And boogie!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.",7.9
S01E20,monica,"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..",7.9
S01E20,joey,Yeah?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..",7.9
S01E20,joey,..Naughty!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Right, I'll see you guys later...",7.9
S01E20,joey,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah...",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?",7.9
S01E20,monica,Why don't you just take it with you?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?",7.9
S01E20,monica,Why don't you just call her?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.",7.9
S01E20,monica,Do you?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"No!  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...",7.9
S01E20,monica,Don't you have to pee?,7.9
S01E20,chandler,'S'why I'm dancing...,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Mindy.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Hey, you.... So, what's up?",7.9

S01E20,rachel,Okay.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Of course!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Was that all you wanted to ask me?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Ohhhh!!  ...What? What?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Oh sure it is!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Um, what- what would make you think that?",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,What? What's what you were afraid of?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,What?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,Smell familiar?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Oh, I am so sorry.",7.9

S01E20,chandler,"Ring dammit, ring!",7.9
S01E20,ross,Thanks.,7.9
S01E20,joey,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?",7.9
S01E20,chandler,What?!,7.9
S01E20,joey,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",7.9
S01E20,chandler,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",7.9
S01E20,monica,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.,7.9
S01E20,joey,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",7.9
S01E20,chandler,Nngghhh!!!!!!!,7.9

S01E20,joey,"Yeah. Yeah, so what?  Mostly free weights, but occasionally..",7.9
S01E20,monica,Joey!!,7.9
S01E20,joey,She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.,7.9
S01E20,monica,The green dress? Really?,7.9
S01E20,joey,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.",7.9

S01E20,rachel,Even when we were having sex in that chair?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.",7.9
S01E20,rachel,"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!",7.9
S01E20,rachel,Oh God.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.,7.9
S01E20,monica,You okay?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,Yeah.,7.9
S01E20,monica,Really?,7.9
S01E20,rachel,"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.",7.9
S01E20,monica,Aww...,7.9
S01E20,joey,Big day.,7.9
S01E20,joey,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...",7.9

S01E20,chandler,...I dunno.,7.9
S01E20,rachel,You don't know?!,7.9
S01E20,chandler,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?",7.9
S01E21,joey,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?,7.9
S01E21,monica,I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.",7.9
S01E21,monica,I know. It's just such reckless spending.,7.9
S01E21,ross,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.",7.9
S01E21,monica,That's me.,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!",7.9

S01E21,rachel,Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!,7.9
S01E21,ross,What?,7.9
S01E21,rachel,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",7.9
S01E21,monica,This woman's living my life.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,What?,7.9
S01E21,monica,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.",7.9
S01E21,rachel,You're not an artist.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.",7.9
S01E21,monica,"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.",7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...",7.9
S01E21,monica,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?,7.9
S01E21,rachel,Nooo...,7.9
S01E21,monica,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,How about Joey... Pepponi?,7.9
S01E21,joey,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,Joey... Switzerland?,7.9
S01E21,joey,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,7.9
S01E21,joey,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.,7.9
S01E21,chandler,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me...",7.9
S01E21,joey,"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,Might wanna try Joseph.,7.9
S01E21,joey,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!,7.9
S01E21,chandler,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.",7.9
S01E21,rachel,Hey.,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,Hey.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,What are you doing?,7.9
S01E21,monica,I'm going to tap class.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?",7.9
S01E21,monica,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.",7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.",7.9
S01E21,monica,What d'you think?,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,Lotsa things.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,Which one do you think she is?,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.",7.9
S01E21,rachel,What does she mean?,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,I think she means,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",7.9
S01E21,rachel,She could be you.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Okay, I'm not getting this!",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,I'm totally getting it!,7.9
S01E21,monica,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,7.9
S01E21,rachel,What? You just click when they click.,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.",7.9
S01E21,monica,Great. It's gym class all over again.,7.9
S01E21,monica,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.,7.9
S01E21,monica,Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.,7.9
S01E21,monica,Yeah. It's Dutch.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.",7.9
S01E21,ross,Hi.,7.9
S01E21,joey,Where've you been?,7.9
S01E21,ross,At the vet.,7.9
S01E21,chandler,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",7.9
S01E21,ross,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,7.9
S01E21,joey,Hey! He beat ya.,7.9
S01E21,ross,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,So what does this mean?,7.9
S01E21,ross,I'm gonna have to give him up.,7.9
S01E21,joey,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",7.9
S01E21,chandler,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?",7.9
S01E21,ross,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.",7.9
S01E21,joey,Isn't there any way you can keep him?,7.9
S01E21,ross,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",7.9
S01E21,joey,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,7.9
S01E21,chandler,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,What?,7.9
S01E21,joey,Did you call the cops?,7.9
S01E21,rachel,Nope. We took her to lunch.,7.9
S01E21,chandler,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,7.9
S01E21,ross,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",7.9
S01E21,chandler,...Take off their hats!,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,No way. No way did you do this.,7.9
S01E21,monica,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,7.9
S01E21,monica,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.",7.9
S01E21,monica,'Scuse me?,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",7.9
S01E21,monica,What?,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",7.9
S01E21,monica,Uh-huh.,7.9
S01E21,monica,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,7.9
S01E21,ross,"That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,7.9
S01E21,ross,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Oh, somebody will.",7.9
S01E21,joey,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,7.9
S01E21,chandler,You're kidding.,7.9
S01E21,joey,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,7.9
S01E21,chandler,"Y'know, you'd think I would've.",7.9
S01E21,joey,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,7.9
S01E21,phoebe,...Flame Boy.,7.9
S01E21,ross,Where exactly is your zoo?,7.9
S01E21,ross,Yes.,7.9
S01E21,ross,"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Well I, I don't know. Why?",7.9
S01E21,ross,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",7.9
S01E21,ross,Why- why- why would he need a blade?,7.9
S01E21,joey,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",7.9
S01E21,chandler,...He's in.,7.9
S01E21,ross,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",7.9
S01E21,monica,Yo- hooo!,7.9
S01E21,rachel,Where the hell've you been?,7.9
S01E21,monica,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,Are you drunk?!,7.9
S01E21,monica,Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",7.9
S01E21,rachel,Monica? Monica!,7.9
S01E21,monica,Water rules!,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?",7.9
S01E21,monica,Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",7.9
S01E21,monica,"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!",7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.",7.9
S01E21,monica,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,What?,7.9
S01E21,monica,They've arrested Monica.,7.9
S01E21,monica,Hi.,7.9
S01E21,monica,How are you?,7.9
S01E21,monica,Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",7.9
S01E21,monica,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!",7.9
S01E21,monica,"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?",7.9
S01E21,monica,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering.",7.9
S01E21,monica,Not necessarily...,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Um, I'm not actually Amish.",7.9
S01E21,monica,In.,7.9
S01E21,monica,"Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,"Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.",7.9
S01E21,phoebe,Oh!,7.9
S01E21,chandler,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.",7.9
S01E21,joey,"I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Just, just say what you feel.",7.9
S01E21,joey,"Marcel, I'm hungry.",7.9
S01E21,ross,That was good.,7.9
S01E21,rachel,"Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.",7.9
S01E21,ross,"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.",7.9
S01E21,joey,"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.",7.9
S01E21,joey,Holden McGroin.,7.9
S01E22,monica,Tell him.,8.3
S01E22,rachel,No.,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,"Tell him, tell him.",8.3
S01E22,monica,Just...please tell him.,8.3
S01E22,rachel,Shut up!,8.3
S01E22,chandler,Tell me what?,8.3
S01E22,monica,"Look at you, you won't even look at him.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,"Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...",8.3
S01E22,phoebe,Doing it on this table.,8.3
S01E22,chandler,Wow!,8.3
S01E22,joey,Exellent dream score.,8.3
S01E22,ross,"Why, why, why would you dream that?",8.3
S01E22,chandler,"More importantly, was I any good?",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"Well, you were pretty damn good.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.",8.3
S01E22,ross,"I love it, when we share.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,You're okay there?,8.3
S01E22,ross,I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.,8.3
S01E22,chandler,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.",8.3

S01E22,chandler,"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.",8.3
S01E22,phoebe,I could be a secretary.,8.3

S01E22,ross,"Oh, it's my new beeper.",8.3
S01E22,joey,What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?,8.3

S01E22,rachel,"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.",8.3
S01E22,monica,What?,8.3
S01E22,rachel,Could tonight be the Night?,8.3

S01E22,phoebe,"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,Why not?,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.",8.3

S01E22,phoebe,Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.,8.3
S01E22,chandler,What are you talking about?,8.3

S01E22,chandler,I can't belive it.,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,They do me?,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?',8.3

S01E22,ross,'The hills were alive with the sound of music.',8.3

S01E22,monica,How was that possible?,8.3
S01E22,monica,Okay.,8.3
S01E22,monica,Unless...,8.3
S01E22,monica,"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...",8.3
S01E22,monica,"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'",8.3
S01E22,monica,Ethan?,8.3
S01E22,monica,Are you a virgin?,8.3
S01E22,monica,Really?,8.3

S01E22,monica,"Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.",8.3
S01E22,monica,"But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.",8.3
S01E22,monica,You're not a senior?,8.3
S01E22,monica,Ok...ay.,8.3
S01E22,monica,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.",8.3
S01E22,monica,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?",8.3
S01E22,monica,"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?",8.3
S01E22,monica,Don't say it.,8.3
S01E22,monica,Really?,8.3
S01E22,monica,"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.",8.3
S01E22,ross,Just easier that way.,8.3
S01E22,chandler,"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"No, forget it.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too.",8.3
S01E22,joey,All right.,8.3
S01E22,ross,"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.",8.3
S01E22,rachel,No.,8.3
S01E22,ross,"You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"No, it was just the three of us.",8.3
S01E22,ross,Huh!,8.3
S01E22,joey,"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?",8.3
S01E22,rachel,You know what?,8.3
S01E22,joey,What?,8.3
S01E22,rachel,There were times when it wasn't even me.,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,"That is so sweet, you guys.",8.3
S01E22,rachel,"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?",8.3
S01E22,monica,What?,8.3
S01E22,rachel,Ethan called again.,8.3
S01E22,monica,Oh.,8.3
S01E22,ross,Are you not seeing him anymore?,8.3
S01E22,monica,"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.",8.3
S01E22,chandler,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.,8.3
S01E22,rachel,"I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.",8.3
S01E22,joey,"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?",8.3
S01E22,ross,"Oh, yeah.",8.3
S01E22,monica,"Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?",8.3
S01E22,ross,It's morphin time!,8.3
S01E22,joey,Stegosaurus!,8.3
S01E22,chandler,Tyrannosaurus!,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,"Ooh, oh, I've gotta go.  Cool!",8.3
S01E22,rachel,Where are you going?,8.3
S01E22,phoebe,"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.",8.3

S01E24,ross,"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.",8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.",8.9

S01E24,ross,....I have to go to China.,8.9
S01E24,joey,The country?,8.9
S01E24,ross,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.",8.9
S01E24,joey,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?,8.9
S01E24,chandler,Forget about her.,8.9
S01E24,joey,"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Course there, they just call it food.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?",8.9
S01E24,joey,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.",8.9
S01E24,ross,I know.,8.9
S01E24,joey,"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.,8.9
S01E24,joey,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,NA,8.9
S01E24,monica,"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.",8.9
S01E24,monica,"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?",8.9
S01E24,joey,"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...",8.9
S01E24,joey,"Then you do. Heh, heh.",8.9
S01E24,monica,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?",8.9
S01E24,joey,What do you mean?,8.9
S01E24,monica,"Y'know, just be there for her.",8.9
S01E24,joey,Not following you.,8.9
S01E24,monica,Think about it.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"OK, I'm guessing this is from...",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Well, thank you, Melanie.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"OK, this one right here is from me.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,NA,8.9
S01E24,rachel,This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!,8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Who's this from?,8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Oh, that's Ross's.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.,8.9
S01E24,phoebe,Remembered what?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?",8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",8.9
S01E24,monica,I can't believe he did this.,8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,What did you just say?,8.9
S01E24,chandler,ahem... um... Crystal duck.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?",8.9
S01E24,chandler,F-hah.... flennin....,8.9
S01E24,rachel,Oh.... my God.,8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no....",8.9
S01E24,joey,"That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"I mean, this is unbelievable.",8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"I know. This is really, really huge.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.,8.9
S01E24,phoebe,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.,8.9
S01E24,chandler,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?",8.9
S01E24,monica,"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?",8.9
S01E24,joey,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,H-He's in China!,8.9
S01E24,joey,The country.,8.9
S01E24,monica,"No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,What about the time difference?,8.9
S01E24,monica,From here to the airport?,8.9
S01E24,chandler,Yes!  You're never gonna make it!,8.9
S01E24,monica,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,I-I-I don't know.,8.9
S01E24,chandler,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.,8.9
S01E24,joey,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",8.9
S01E24,monica,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.,8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"Here, look, alright, does this help?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!",8.9
S01E24,ross,NA,8.9
S01E24,ross,Ni-chou chi-ma!,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Hi.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Uh... I don't know.,8.9
S01E24,joey,"Heh, heh. It was nothin'.",8.9
S01E24,joey,"Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",8.9
S01E24,joey,Sure! Why not?,8.9
S01E24,joey,How do you mean?,8.9
S01E24,monica,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.",8.9
S01E24,monica,"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!",8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.",8.9
S01E24,monica,Another good point.,8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Huh?,8.9
S01E24,phoebe,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?",8.9
S01E24,monica,Why isn't it working out?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.,8.9
S01E24,monica,Is he not cute enough for you?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,No!,8.9
S01E24,monica,Does he not make enough money?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"No, I'm just....",8.9
S01E24,phoebe,Maybe there's someone else.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,Wha...,8.9
S01E24,monica,Is there? Is there someone else?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,No! There is.. there is noone else!,8.9
S01E24,monica,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?,8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Hey, big...",8.9
S01E24,joey,Shhhh!,8.9
S01E24,chandler,...spender.,8.9
S01E24,joey,She's still asleep.,8.9
S01E24,chandler,So how'd it go?,8.9
S01E24,joey,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",8.9
S01E24,chandler,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,8.9
S01E24,joey,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.",8.9
S01E24,joey,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,I didn't know you had another level.,8.9
S01E24,joey,I know! Neither did I!,8.9
S01E24,monica,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Yeah.,8.9
S01E24,monica,"Oh, from who?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.,8.9
S01E24,monica,"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.",8.9
S01E24,monica,"Oh, why?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...",8.9
S01E24,monica,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...",8.9
S01E24,monica,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Who is it?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,C'mon up.,8.9
S01E24,monica,Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,8.9
S01E24,joey,Seven hundred bucks!,8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?",8.9
S01E24,joey,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",8.9
S01E24,chandler,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?",8.9
S01E24,joey,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?",8.9
S01E24,ross,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Fine, just stop thinking about me.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Can't do it, can you?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,So I'm thinking about you. So what?,8.9
S01E24,ross,"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....,8.9
S01E24,ross,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Ross, it's too hard.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Ross, you're like my best friend.",8.9
S01E24,ross,I know.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"If we broke up, and I lost you...",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?",8.9
S01E24,ross,"No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Well, start looking.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,Wow.,8.9
S01E24,rachel,Right! You're right!,8.9
S01E24,rachel,You know what?,8.9
S01E24,rachel,"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.",8.9
S01E24,rachel,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",8.9
S01E24,ross,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.,8.9
S01E24,ross,Yeah.,8.9
S01E24,ross,"No, no, they will. I just... uh...",8.9
S01E24,ross,"Come on, they're gonna love you.",8.9
S02E01,phoebe,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \forget about her\"" but when Ross was in China on his dig",8.9
S02E01,rachel,Oh my god. Oh my god.,8.9
S02E01,ross,Rach!,8.9
S02E01,rachel,"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",8.9
S02E01,ross,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?",8.9
S02E01,rachel,What?,8.9
S02E01,ross,You're bleeding.,8.9
S02E01,rachel,"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.",8.9
S02E01,ross,"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.",8.9
S02E01,rachel,"These are, these aren't for you.  Welcome to our country.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,No way!,8.5
S02E01,monica,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?",8.5
S02E01,joey,"Um, this?",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Yes.,8.5
S02E01,monica,"Guys, you got your hair cut.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"'Cause, you know,  if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"You, you slowpokes!",8.5
S02E01,ross,"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?",8.5
S02E01,joey,What up?!,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Everyone, this is Julie.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,Julie.,8.5
S02E01,ross,And bus.,8.5
S02E01,ross,The screaming guy?,8.5
S02E01,ross,You gotta hear this story.,8.5
S02E01,ross,200 at least.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",8.5
S02E01,ross,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",8.5
S02E01,monica,It's an expression.,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.",8.5
S02E01,ross,"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,Bye.,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Yeah, sure.",8.5
S02E01,ross,Thank you.,8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Hey, Rach, can I get...",8.5
S02E01,rachel,Did you talk to him?,8.5
S02E01,chandler,Not yet.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Then, no.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",8.5
S02E01,ross,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",8.5
S02E01,chandler,God?,8.5
S02E01,ross,"It was you, pal.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",8.5
S02E01,ross,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Well, you owe me one, big guy.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,Here's your lemonade.,8.5
S02E01,ross,I didn't order lemonade.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.",8.5
S02E01,ross,But...,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Go-go-go-go, come on!  So uh, what did you find out?",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,How is that the silver lining?,8.5
S02E01,chandler,You have to really wanna see it.,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?",8.5
S02E01,monica,"No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"All right, so what were you thinking?",8.5
S02E01,monica,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Ohh! No.,8.5
S02E01,monica,Why not?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.",8.5
S02E01,monica,No you're not.,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",8.5
S02E01,joey,NA,8.5
S02E01,ross,Hello? Hi.,8.5
S02E01,chandler,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?,8.5
S02E01,joey,Needs some clothes altered?,8.5
S02E01,chandler,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",8.5
S02E01,joey,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?",8.5
S02E01,chandler,Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!,8.5
S02E01,ross,Well you didn't hang up either.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,She didn't hang up either!,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.",8.5
S02E01,ross,Rachel! I'll just call her back.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,Okay!,8.5
S02E01,ross,NA,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.",8.5
S02E01,joey,"You know, I think I was sixteen.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"Please, just a little bit off the back.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"I'm still on \no.\""",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",8.5
S02E01,joey,"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,What's goin' on?,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,What stupid thing did you do?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Ewww!,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"Rachel, how did this happen?",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Where?,8.5
S02E01,rachel,At his apartment. Is this juice?,8.5
S02E01,joey,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,People do stupid things when they're upset.,8.5
S02E01,monica,"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.",8.5
S02E01,ross,"Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.",8.5
S02E01,ross,"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?",8.5
S02E01,ross,"So, uh, he's back.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?",8.5
S02E01,ross,"No, not a problem.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.",8.5
S02E01,joey,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?,8.5
S02E01,monica,"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.",8.5
S02E01,monica,I promise.,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"All right.  Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"All right, that's it, I quit.",8.5
S02E01,monica,What? I didn't say anything.,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Yeah, but this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.",8.5
S02E01,monica,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.,8.5
S02E01,monica,How who wears it?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Demi Moore.,8.5
S02E01,monica,Demi Moore is not a he.,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.",8.5

S02E01,chandler,At least as long as I have the pants.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,How is she?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",8.5
S02E01,ross,How's the hair?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",8.5
S02E01,joey,Can we see her?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.",8.5
S02E01,ross,Yeah.,8.5
S02E01,joey,How're you doing?,8.5
S02E01,rachel,I'm okay.,8.5
S02E01,joey,"Ooh, that bad, huh?",8.5

S02E01,joey,"Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.",8.5
S02E01,joey,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,8.5
S02E01,joey,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"I don't know, I don't know.",8.5
S02E01,joey,"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",8.5
S02E01,chandler,Your tailor is a very bad man!,8.5
S02E01,joey,Frankie? What're you talking about?,8.5

S02E01,chandler,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",8.5
S02E01,ross,What?,8.5
S02E01,chandler,Cupping.,8.5
S02E01,joey,"That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",8.5
S02E01,ross,"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?",8.5
S02E01,joey,What? That's not?  Oh my God.,8.5
S02E01,monica,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.,8.5
S02E01,ross,"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.",8.5
S02E01,monica,Thank you. My hair is very amused.,8.5
S02E01,chandler,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,Thank you.,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.",8.5

S02E01,ross,What's goin' on?,8.5
S02E01,rachel,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?",8.5
S02E01,ross,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?",8.5
S02E01,rachel,No. No-no-no-no.,8.5
S02E01,ross,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.",8.5
S02E01,rachel,Really?,8.5
S02E01,ross,"You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking \Oh my god",8.5
S02E01,rachel,"No, I think that was the whole all.",8.5
S02E01,ross,Okay.  Okay.  Okay.,8.5
S02E01,joey,"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.",8.5
S02E01,phoebe,You wanna do it right now?,8.5
S02E01,phoebe,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",8.5

S02E02,chandler,"You know, it's...",8.2
S02E02,joey,"I gotta get one, too.",8.2
S02E02,ross,What are you guys doing?,8.2
S02E02,chandler,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?,8.2
S02E02,ross,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.",8.2
S02E02,joey,"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",8.2
S02E02,ross,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",8.2
S02E02,ross,Carol?,8.2
S02E02,chandler,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?,8.2
S02E02,joey,"Uh, does it hurt?",8.2
S02E02,joey,Chandler?,8.2
S02E02,chandler,"So, uh, how often can you do it?",8.2

S02E02,joey,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?,8.2
S02E02,monica,"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?",8.2
S02E02,chandler,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",8.2
S02E02,monica,But I'm...,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.",8.2
S02E02,ross,"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?",8.2
S02E02,monica,"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.",8.2
S02E02,ross,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.",8.2
S02E02,monica,You're welcome.,8.2

S02E02,rachel,You bought boobs?,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.,8.2
S02E02,joey,"Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",8.2
S02E02,joey,Bijan for men?!,8.2
S02E02,ross,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Oh, this is so cute.",8.2
S02E02,ross,My mommies love me. That's clever.,8.2
S02E02,monica,"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—",8.2

S02E02,phoebe,"Ben, dinner!",8.2
S02E02,ross,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",8.2
S02E02,phoebe,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",8.2
S02E02,chandler,What did you just do?,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,"I licked my arm, what?",8.2
S02E02,ross,It's breast milk.,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,So?,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",8.2
S02E02,joey,What is the big deal?,8.2
S02E02,chandler,What did you just do?,8.2
S02E02,ross,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",8.2
S02E02,phoebe,You won't even taste it?,8.2
S02E02,ross,No!,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,8.2
S02E02,ross,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.,8.2
S02E02,monica,"Hey, where is everybody?",8.2
S02E02,rachel,They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?,8.2
S02E02,monica,"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way.",8.2
S02E02,monica,Okay.,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?",8.2
S02E02,monica,You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.,8.2
S02E02,rachel,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?,8.2
S02E02,monica,That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",8.2
S02E02,monica,Judy.,8.2
S02E02,rachel,Who?,8.2
S02E02,monica,Julie.,8.2

S02E02,monica,Jody!,8.2
S02E02,rachel,You were with Julie?,8.2
S02E02,monica,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,Oh. Oh my God.,8.2
S02E02,monica,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Yeah, right.  Sure!",8.2
S02E02,monica,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",8.2
S02E02,monica,That is not true!,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",8.2
S02E02,monica,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?",8.2
S02E02,monica,"Hi, Steve.",8.2
S02E02,phoebe,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",8.2
S02E02,ross,I did not freak out.,8.2
S02E02,ross,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.,8.2
S02E02,ross,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",8.2
S02E02,chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,8.2
S02E02,ross,That would be no.,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,8.2
S02E02,joey,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...",8.2
S02E02,joey,Exactly.,8.2

S02E02,ross,"Oh, you've tasted it.",8.2
S02E02,ross,NA,8.2
S02E02,chandler,Howdy.,8.2
S02E02,joey,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",8.2
S02E02,chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",8.2
S02E02,joey,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",8.2
S02E02,chandler,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,8.2
S02E02,joey,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",8.2
S02E02,chandler,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",8.2
S02E02,joey,Yeah I guess you're right.,8.2
S02E02,chandler,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,8.2
S02E02,joey,I'm gonna do it.,8.2
S02E02,chandler,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.,8.2
S02E02,monica,I don't know what else to say.,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",8.2
S02E02,monica,"I feel terrible, I really do.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",8.2
S02E02,monica,"Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",8.2
S02E02,rachel,Yes.,8.2
S02E02,monica,It's that terrible?,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.",8.2
S02E02,monica,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,I love you too.,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too.",8.2
S02E02,monica,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"I'd do anything for you, you know that.",8.2
S02E02,monica,NA,8.2
S02E02,phoebe,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!",8.2
S02E02,joey,"Mornin'.  I said, mornin'.",8.2
S02E02,joey,"Yeah, I'm ready.",8.2
S02E02,joey,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",8.2
S02E02,rachel,Really? Me?,8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,"All right, Julie.",8.2
S02E02,rachel,Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.,8.2
S02E02,ross,That's not bad.,8.2
S02E03,chandler,Hey.,8.4
S02E03,monica,So how was Joan?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,I broke up with her.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Come on, they were not that huge.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.",8.4
S02E03,monica,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,8.4
S02E03,joey,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,You or me?,8.4
S02E03,ross,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.",8.4
S02E03,joey,"You guys are messin' with me, right?",8.4
S02E03,joey,"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, \whoa.\""",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,Maureen Rosilla.,8.4
S02E03,ross,Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.,8.4
S02E03,monica,"Hello, Mr. Heckles.",8.4
S02E03,monica,We're not doing anything.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,You don't have birds.,8.4
S02E03,monica,"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"All right, bye-bye.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.",8.4
S02E03,ross,We'll give you Janice.,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,I miss Janice though. \Hello,8.4
S02E03,rachel,\Oh,8.4

S02E03,rachel,We won. We won!,8.4
S02E03,monica,Mr. Heckles.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,How did this happen?,8.4
S02E03,monica,That's terrible.,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Ok, Phoebe.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",8.4
S02E03,joey,Such as?,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",8.4
S02E03,ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Nah. Not really.,8.4
S02E03,ross,You don't believe in evolution?,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",8.4
S02E03,ross,"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Yeah, I just don't buy it.",8.4
S02E03,ross,"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",8.4
S02E03,ross,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",8.4
S02E03,monica,What can we do for you?,8.4
S02E03,monica,"Well, what about his family?",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Ok, so let's talk money.",8.4
S02E03,monica,"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",8.4
S02E03,rachel,Have you ever seen so much crap?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",8.4
S02E03,joey,Check this out. Can I have this?,8.4
S02E03,ross,How can you not believe in evolution?,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!,8.4
S02E03,ross,"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Really? You can actually see it?,8.4
S02E03,ross,"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"See, I didn't know that.",8.4
S02E03,ross,"Well, there you go.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Hey, look at this. \My Big Book of Grievances.\""",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",8.4
S02E03,monica,"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",8.4
S02E03,monica,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Well, what about my stuff?",8.4
S02E03,monica,You don't have any stuff.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",8.4
S02E03,monica,No.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",8.4
S02E03,monica,Mmmmm.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Ok, while you \mmm\"" on it for awhile",8.4
S02E03,ross,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,8.4
S02E03,ross,Please tell me you're joking.,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",8.4
S02E03,ross,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",8.4
S02E03,ross,Is there blood coming out of my ears?,8.4
S02E03,joey,"Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Wow, he looks so normal.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,He's even kind of cute.,8.4
S02E03,joey,\Heckles,8.4
S02E03,chandler,Funniest? Heckles?,8.4
S02E03,joey,That's what it says.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,I'd call that excessive.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,Whoa!,8.4
S02E03,joey,What?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.",8.4
S02E03,joey,"So, you were both dorks. Big deal.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?",8.4
S02E03,joey,Have you been here all night?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.",8.4
S02E03,joey,"All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \supposably\""?""",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,How do you know that? How?,8.4
S02E03,joey,"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Yeah, I understand.",8.4
S02E03,joey,"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",8.4
S02E03,chandler,You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.,8.4
S02E03,joey,Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Hi, it's me.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Janice? You called Janice?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",8.4
S02E03,ross,"You remember Janice, right?",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Oh, my, god!",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Geez, look how fat she got.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Janice, you're--",8.4
S02E03,chandler,Is it--?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,Congratulations.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?,8.4
S02E03,monica,"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",8.4
S02E03,rachel,What?,8.4
S02E03,monica,Hide the Lamp.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Monica, let it go.",8.4
S02E03,monica,Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.,8.4
S02E03,ross,"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",8.4
S02E03,ross,"It's the only possibility, Phoebe.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",8.4
S02E03,ross,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,I can't believe you caved.,8.4
S02E03,ross,What?,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",8.4
S02E03,rachel,I am. Let me just get my coat.,8.4
S02E03,monica,"Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",8.4
S02E03,monica,"Phoebe, tell her!",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,Neat. I'm gonna die alone.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Ok, you win.",8.4
S02E03,monica,"Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.",8.4
S02E03,phoebe,Uh huh. Why is that?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \Run away from Crazy Snake Man",8.4
S02E03,monica,You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,"Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.",8.4
S02E03,monica,You are not a freak. You're a guy.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.,8.4
S02E03,monica,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,In a bad way?,8.4
S02E03,monica,"No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,"Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!",8.4
S02E03,monica,You made it!,8.4
S02E03,phoebe,You're there!,8.4
S02E03,rachel,You are ready to make a commitment!,8.4
S02E03,chandler,Whoa! Don't know about that.,8.4
S02E03,rachel,What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?,8.4
S02E03,monica,"No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,Thank you.,8.4
S02E03,monica,That's fine.,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?",8.4
S02E03,chandler,I'll take that.,8.4
S02E03,joey,You want his yearbook?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.",8.4
S02E03,monica,"Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.",8.4
S02E03,rachel,It's really not that big!,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Takin' that with you, huh?",8.4
S02E03,joey,"Oh, yeah.",8.4
S02E03,ross,You comin'?,8.4
S02E03,chandler,"Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.",8.4
S02E03,chandler,Sure.,8.4
S02E04,rachel,"Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing [a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the table] OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. [hangs up] OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. [grabs a pot and lid] OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. [puts pot over the pigeon] Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. [knock at the door] It's open you guys.",8
S02E04,rachel,"Hi, hi can I help you?",8
S02E04,rachel,"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.",8
S02E04,rachel,What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away],8
S02E04,joey,"This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?",8
S02E04,phoebe,"Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.",8
S02E04,monica,"I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",8
S02E04,phoebe,"I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.",8
S02E04,monica,"Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?",8
S02E04,ross,"You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.",8
S02E04,phoebe,"OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.",8
S02E04,monica,"Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",8
S02E04,monica,"Well, didn't you?",8
S02E04,phoebe,I might have.,8
S02E04,monica,I can't believe you didn't tell me.,8
S02E04,phoebe,"Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.",8
S02E04,monica,What have I not told you?,8
S02E04,phoebe,"Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.",8
S02E04,rachel,What!,8
S02E04,monica,"Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.",8
S02E04,chandler,I didn't know it was a big secret.,8
S02E04,monica,"Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.",8
S02E04,phoebe,You have a third nipple?,8
S02E04,chandler,You bitch.,8
S02E04,ross,"Whip it out, whip it out.",8
S02E04,chandler,"C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.",8
S02E04,rachel,"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?",8
S02E04,joey,I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.,8
S02E04,ross,"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?",8
S02E04,joey,"I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.",8
S02E04,chandler,Joey was in a porno movie.,8
S02E04,chandler,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.",8
S02E04,ross,You were in a porno?,8
S02E04,joey,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.",8
S02E04,monica,That is wild.,8
S02E04,ross,[to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?,8
S02E04,phoebe,"Yeah, is there a hair on it?",8
S02E04,joey,What happens if you flick it?,8
S02E04,ross,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?",8
S02E04,chandler,"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",8
S02E04,chandler,"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?",8
S02E04,ross,"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?",8
S02E04,rachel,"[to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.",8
S02E04,monica,"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",8
S02E04,rachel,"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.",8
S02E04,joey,Foxy lady.,8
S02E04,phoebe,"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.",8
S02E04,joey,The Ice Capades?,8
S02E04,chandler,"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",8
S02E04,monica,"I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",8
S02E04,phoebe,"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",8
S02E04,ross,"[holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?",8
S02E04,chandler,"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .",8
S02E04,ross,"OK sweetie, I'll see you later.",8
S02E04,rachel,Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves],8

S02E04,rachel,"What? C'mon, talk to me.",8
S02E04,ross,"OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?",8
S02E04,rachel,"Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?",8
S02E04,ross,"Technically, huh, no.",8
S02E04,rachel,"Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?",8
S02E04,ross,"No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .",8
S02E04,rachel,"No, no no no, don't need to know the details.",8
S02E04,ross,"It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.",8
S02E04,rachel,"No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?",8
S02E04,ross,What?,8
S02E04,rachel,I think it's sexy.,8
S02E04,ross,Sexy?,8
S02E04,rachel,Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.,8
S02E04,ross,No kidding?,8
S02E04,rachel,Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?,8
S02E04,ross,What?,8
S02E04,rachel,I'd wait.,8
S02E04,ross,You'd wait?,8
S02E04,rachel,"Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.",8
S02E04,ross,Really?,8
S02E04,rachel,"Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.",8
S02E04,ross,Women really want this?,8
S02E04,rachel,"More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]",8
S02E04,phoebe,Hi.,8
S02E04,phoebe,Ta-da.,8
S02E04,phoebe,Hi.,8
S02E04,phoebe,"Do I? Thank you, so do you.",8
S02E04,phoebe,"Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.",8
S02E04,phoebe,"Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.",8
S02E04,phoebe,OK.,8
S02E04,phoebe,"Oh, right, OK. Ole.",8

S02E04,ross,"Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. [hands her a bowl and kisses her]",8
S02E04,chandler,"Uh, Julie.",8
S02E04,chandler,"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.",8
S02E04,ross,Hi everyone.,8
S02E04,ross,"[pulls Rachel aside] I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.",8
S02E04,rachel,"Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?",8
S02E04,ross,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.",8
S02E04,rachel,"What did, what did he say?",8
S02E04,ross,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .",8
S02E04,chandler,What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.,8
S02E04,ross,Pop it in.,8
S02E04,joey,"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. [Chandler puts the tape in]",8
S02E04,rachel,"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.",8
S02E04,ross,What's wrong with people having sex?,8
S02E04,rachel,"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",8

S02E04,ross,"I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.",8
S02E04,ross,"Wha, uhh, what?",8
S02E04,rachel,"Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.",8
S02E04,ross,"OK, now I'm nervous.",8
S02E04,rachel,Maybe you should put it off.,8
S02E04,ross,"No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.",8

S02E04,ross,Really?,8
S02E04,rachel,"Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",8
S02E04,ross,[being drawn in by her talk] Uh-huh.,8
S02E04,rachel,"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",8
S02E04,ross,"Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. [goes back in apartment]",8

S02E05,phoebe,Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?,8.3
S02E05,rachel,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?",8.3
S02E05,joey,"Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \let's go here",8.3
S02E05,phoebe,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",8.3

S02E05,joey,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",8.3
S02E05,monica,"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.",8.3
S02E05,joey,"Yeah, someplace nice.",8.3
S02E05,ross,I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.,8.3
S02E05,chandler,"Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.",8.3
S02E05,ross,"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.",8.3
S02E05,chandler,"We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.",8.3
S02E05,ross,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.,8.3

S02E05,chandler,"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.",8.3
S02E05,ross,"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?",8.3
S02E05,monica,"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.",8.3
S02E05,ross,That sounds great. Same for me.,8.3
S02E05,joey,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?",8.3
S02E05,rachel,"Ok, I will have the uh,  side salad.",8.3
S02E05,rachel,"Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?",8.3

S02E05,ross,That's a good point.,8.3
S02E05,chandler,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",8.3

S02E05,ross,"Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?",8.3
S02E05,rachel,"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.",8.3
S02E05,monica,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.",8.3

S02E05,phoebe,"Actually, it makes us feel that big.",8.3
S02E05,ross,"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.",8.3
S02E05,chandler,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.",8.3
S02E05,joey,"Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.",8.3
S02E05,rachel,"Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.",8.3

S02E05,monica,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,8.3

I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?",8.5
S02E08,joey,You got all that from saline solution?,8.5
S02E08,ross,"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.",8.5

S02E08,ross,"[uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?",8.5

S02E08,joey,"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.",8.5
S02E08,ross,[to Joey] Ssshh.,8.5
S02E08,ross,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",8.5
S02E08,joey,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]",8.5
S02E08,joey,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",8.5
S02E08,ross,Can't we just use a pen?,8.5
S02E08,joey,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",8.5
S02E08,joey,You could say that.,8.5
S02E08,ross,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",8.5
S02E08,ross,I don't know.,8.5
S02E08,joey,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.",8.5
S02E08,ross,[long pause] She's not Rachel.,8.5
S02E08,joey,"[to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.",8.5
S02E08,ross,Hi.,8.5
S02E08,ross,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Well, uh.",8.5
S02E08,joey,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Really. It's always been you, Rach.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Hey, someone order a coat?",8.5
S02E08,ross,"He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?",8.5
S02E08,joey,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?",8.5
S02E08,ross,That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.,8.5
S02E08,ross,"No, you don't.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type \little\""",8.5
S02E08,ross,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?",8.5
S02E08,ross,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?",8.5
S02E08,joey,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!",8.5
S02E08,ross,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.,8.5
S02E08,joey,"[opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?",8.5
S02E08,joey,"Oh, yeah, I do.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"I am, uh, I am...",8.5
S02E08,ross,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.",8.5
S02E08,ross,No?,8.5
S02E08,ross,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",8.5
S02E08,ross,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",8.5
S02E08,joey,"[quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer.",8.5
S02E08,ross,Hi.,8.5
S02E08,ross,"Look, can, can you do something for me?",8.5

S02E09,monica,"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",8
S02E09,chandler,And twenty-five it is.,8
S02E09,joey,You gave him cookies?,8
S02E09,monica,"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",8
S02E09,phoebe,I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,8
S02E09,chandler,"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",8
S02E09,phoebe,"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",8
S02E09,ross,"So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?",8
S02E09,rachel,"Uhh, the mailman, the super.",8

S02E09,ross,"Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.",8
S02E09,joey,"I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.",8
S02E09,chandler,Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.,8

S02E09,ross,"Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .",8
S02E09,rachel,Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?,8
S02E09,ross,"How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?",8
S02E09,ross,"Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches]",8

S02E09,phoebe,Hey.,8
S02E09,phoebe,"Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?",8
S02E09,ross,"Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.",8
S02E09,phoebe,"This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.",8
S02E09,chandler,"Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.",8
S02E09,phoebe,"No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.",8
S02E09,rachel,"Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.",8
S02E09,phoebe,"No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.",8
S02E09,rachel,How have you never been on Oprah?,8
S02E09,phoebe,"[showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.",8
S02E09,monica,"Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.",8
S02E09,phoebe,"It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]",8
S02E09,monica,"Oh, wait a minute honey.",8
S02E09,monica,Wow.,8
S02E09,joey,"So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .",8

S02E09,phoebe,"Just, you know, to see... um.",8
S02E09,phoebe,"OK, is this really my father?",8
S02E09,phoebe,"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",8
S02E09,phoebe,"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.",8
S02E09,phoebe,Oh God.,8
S02E09,phoebe,"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",8
S02E09,phoebe,"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",8
S02E09,phoebe,[realizes] Oh.,8
S02E09,phoebe,Oh.,8
S02E09,chandler,"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",8
S02E09,rachel,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",8
S02E09,chandler,Who said anything about Christmas?,8
S02E09,monica,Hi.,8

S02E09,chandler,Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?,8
S02E09,rachel,"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]",8
S02E09,monica,"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",8
S02E09,joey,"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.",8

S02E09,phoebe,"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",8
S02E09,phoebe,Whattaya mean?,8

S02E10,ross,I don't want to.,8
S02E10,ross,Yeah.,8
S02E10,joey,Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.,8
S02E10,ross,"Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.",8
S02E10,joey,"No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.",8
S02E10,joey,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.",8
S02E10,ross,[sullenly] Hiiiiii.,8
S02E10,ross,"Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?",8
S02E10,ross,Don't toy with me.,8
S02E10,ross,"Hey, Fun Bobby!",8
S02E10,ross,"Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!",8
S02E10,joey,"No, I'm alright man. Really.",8
S02E10,joey,"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.",8
S02E10,joey,I just had a glass.,8
S02E10,ross,Oooooh.,8
S02E10,joey,[realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.,8
S02E10,ross,"Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.",8
S02E10,joey,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",8
S02E10,joey,Hey.,8
S02E10,joey,"Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!",8
S02E10,joey,With a man?,8
S02E10,joey,"What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?",8
S02E10,joey,"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.",8
S02E10,joey,No.,8
S02E10,joey,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...",8
S02E10,joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.",8
S02E10,ross,What? What's wrong?,8
S02E10,ross,Alright.,8
S02E10,ross,Hi.,8
S02E10,ross,"Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?",8
S02E10,ross,A date.,8
S02E10,ross,"Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.",8
S02E10,ross,"Yes, yes I am. And you are a....",8
S02E10,ross,"Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.",8
S02E10,ross,"I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.",8
S02E10,ross,"Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.",8
S02E10,ross,"Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...",8
S02E10,ross,"OK, well, um, have a nice evening.",8
S02E10,ross,[upset] She's dating. She's dating.,8
S02E10,ross,What do you mean?,8
S02E10,ross,"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",8
S02E10,ross,....................Yeah.,8
S02E10,joey,Hey.,8
S02E10,joey,"Well, the part's mine if I want it.",8
S02E10,joey,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.",8
S02E10,joey,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.",8
S02E10,joey,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?",8
S02E10,joey,I've never slept with someone for a part.,8
S02E10,joey,Sorry.,8
S02E10,joey,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.",8
S02E10,joey,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",8
S02E10,joey,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",8
S02E10,ross,[condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.,8
S02E10,ross,"[to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.",8
S02E10,ross,"Oh you do, do you?",8
S02E10,ross,Of... of what?,8
S02E10,ross,"Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.",8
S02E10,ross,"No, no, let me finish.",8
S02E10,ross,"No, you let me fini...",8
S02E10,ross,Hi.,8
S02E10,ross,Where ya goin'?,8
S02E10,ross,Ooooohhhh.,8
S02E10,ross,"What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?",8
S02E10,joey,Hey.,8
S02E10,ross,How'd the callback go?,8
S02E10,joey,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,8
S02E10,joey,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",8
S02E10,ross,Good for you.,8
S02E10,joey,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.",8
S02E10,joey,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",8
S02E10,joey,Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves],8
S02E11,ross,"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",8.1
S02E11,ross,Ok.,8.1
S02E11,ross,"Oh, you and me?",8.1
S02E11,ross,Ok.,8.1
S02E11,ross,"As in, \I now pronounce you wife and wife\"" married?""",8.1
S02E11,ross,Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,8.1
S02E11,ross,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",8.1
S02E11,ross,Mmm hmmm.,8.1
S02E11,ross,Uh-huh.,8.1
S02E11,ross,This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,8.1
S02E11,joey,"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",8.1
S02E11,ross,Would it matter?,8.1
S02E11,monica,"Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!",8.1
S02E11,joey,Are you really not going?,8.1
S02E11,ross,"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",8.1
S02E11,monica,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",8.1
S02E11,ross,If you wanna call that a reason.,8.1
S02E11,chandler,"[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Ross, I thought you were over this.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",8.1
S02E11,joey,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,[entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,8.1
S02E11,joey,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Whoa, she's pretty.",8.1
S02E11,joey,"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"I'm sorry, what?",8.1
S02E11,monica,What?,8.1
S02E11,joey,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Oh, ok.",8.1
S02E11,joey,"There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] \Mrs. Wallace",8.1
S02E11,joey,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,8.1
S02E11,chandler,Nice!,8.1
S02E11,rachel,That's great!,8.1
S02E11,ross,Excellent!,8.1
S02E11,chandler,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.,8.1
S02E11,ross,That is so good! Do it again!,8.1
S02E11,joey,"All right, all right. \Damnit Braverman",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"No no, that's me.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Oh, yeah.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Oh, hello.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",8.1
S02E11,ross,Is everything ok?,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",8.1
S02E11,ross,Oh my god.,8.1
S02E11,chandler,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Oh, honey.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \ok",8.1
S02E11,rachel,What do you mean?,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,I think it went into me.,8.1
S02E11,monica,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Ok, who ordered what?",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",8.1
S02E11,rachel,Oh god.,8.1
S02E11,joey,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,8.1
S02E11,rachel,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,8.1
S02E11,joey,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!",8.1
S02E11,rachel,Mom!,8.1
S02E11,rachel,Pretty much.,8.1
S02E11,rachel,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]",8.1
S02E11,rachel,Oh Mom!,8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Believe me, sometimes that happens.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,Really?,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",8.1
S02E11,joey,"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",8.1
S02E11,rachel,For...me.,8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Well, what do you mean?",8.1
S02E11,monica,"[entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.,8.1
S02E11,monica,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,8.1
S02E11,ross,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,8.1
S02E11,rachel,None.,8.1
S02E11,joey,They didn't fight a lot?,8.1
S02E11,rachel,"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"[Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.",8.1
S02E11,joey,"Hey, look who's up.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,That's him.,8.1
S02E11,chandler,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Um, do you wanna sit?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,Everything?,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,These are from Halloween three years ago.,8.1
S02E11,rachel,"No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \thank you",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Actually, what I think you said was, \don't touch that",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?",8.1
S02E11,monica,If you want.,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"[enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,She's still with you?,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,God!,8.1
S02E11,monica,"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,Oh! What's new in sex?,8.1
S02E11,monica,"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",8.1
S02E11,rachel,You want me to talk you out of it?,8.1
S02E11,rachel,Then what? What do you want?,8.1
S02E11,rachel,Why on earth would I understand this?,8.1
S02E11,rachel,Oh.,8.1
S02E11,monica,"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"Joey, speed it up!",8.1
S02E11,joey,"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",8.1
S02E11,monica,Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,Sir! No sir!,8.1
S02E11,monica,"[to Ross] All right, you!",8.1
S02E11,ross,"No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.",8.1
S02E11,monica,"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \pigs in Ross\"". All right",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.",8.1
S02E11,monica,Hi.,8.1
S02E11,monica,It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans],8.1
S02E11,ross,What's the matter?,8.1
S02E11,ross,What?,8.1
S02E11,monica,"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?",8.1
S02E11,ross,Oh my god.,8.1
S02E11,ross,It's ok. I'm sorry.,8.1
S02E11,ross,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",8.1
S02E11,monica,So we're back on?,8.1
S02E11,monica,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",8.1
S02E11,joey,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",8.1
S02E11,ross,Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go],8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",8.1
S02E11,monica,Would you look at them?,8.1
S02E11,ross,"Yeah, can't help but.",8.1
S02E11,joey,[to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.,8.1
S02E11,phoebe,I miss Rose.,8.1
S02E11,chandler,"Oh, yeah?",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Ok, that's so nice.",8.1
S02E11,chandler,"[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"Hey, Mom? Having fun?",8.1
S02E11,rachel,"There's more alcohol, right?",8.1
S02E11,ross,Ok.,8.1
S02E11,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S02E11,ross,"No, that's fine.",8.1
S02E11,ross,Ok.,8.1
S02E11,chandler,[to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.],8.1
S02E11,monica,"Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?",8.1
S02E11,ross,"Well, Mon, I was married.",8.1
S02E11,phoebe,"Yeah, me, too, technically.",8.1
S02E11,rachel,I had a wedding.,8.1
S02E11,monica,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",8.1
S02E11,joey,I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler],8.1
S02E11,chandler,Isn't Ben in this?,8.1
S02E12,ross,That commercial always makes me so sad.,8.6
S02E12,joey,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",8.6
S02E12,ross,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.,8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.",8.6
S02E12,monica,And the fact that they're both monkeys.,8.6
S02E12,ross,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.",8.6
S02E12,rachel,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.",8.6
S02E12,chandler,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.",8.6
S02E12,chandler,Rhythm?,8.6
S02E12,joey,"No, my first fan mail.",8.6
S02E12,monica,"[reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'",8.6
S02E12,rachel,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.",8.6
S02E12,monica,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.",8.6
S02E12,ross,Hey guys.,8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.",8.6
S02E12,chandler,"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.",8.6
S02E12,rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.",8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.",8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"I know, I know. [to Rob] Hello.",8.6

S02E12,joey,"Ah, the stalker.",8.6
S02E12,chandler,"[Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.",8.6
S02E12,joey,Let's get out of here.,8.6
S02E12,chandler,The one time they're not home.,8.6
S02E12,joey,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.",8.6

S02E12,rachel,Oh my God.,8.6
S02E12,monica,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.",8.6
S02E12,chandler,"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.",8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.",8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?",8.6

S02E12,joey,No one.,8.6
S02E12,joey,"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that.",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.",8.6
S02E12,joey,But that's what...,8.6

S02E12,phoebe,Thinkin' about it.,8.6
S02E12,ross,"Buddy, my monkey?",8.6
S02E12,ross,Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.,8.6
S02E12,ross,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.",8.6
S02E12,ross,That guy Lipson?,8.6

S02E12,rachel,"Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?",8.6
S02E12,monica,"Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Hey Erica, c'mon in.",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?",8.6
S02E12,joey,Who?,8.6
S02E12,joey,"It's not what you think, that was...",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.",8.6

S02E12,rachel,"Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]",8.6
S02E12,monica,"And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]",8.6
S02E12,chandler,"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]",8.6
S02E12,joey,"Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.",8.6

S02E12,joey,"OK, alright, the people who threw the water.",8.6
S02E12,phoebe,Fired! Why?,8.6
S02E12,phoebe,I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?,8.6
S02E12,phoebe,I see.,8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?",8.6

S02E12,chandler,"What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.",8.6
S02E12,monica,"Ross, there he is.",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. [Marcel doesn't react so Ross starts singing] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.

S02E12,rachel,"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?",8.6

S02E12,chandler,"OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.",8.6
S02E12,chandler,"Oh uh, o, OK.",8.6

S02E12,rachel,"He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.",8.6
S02E12,monica,"Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...",8.6
S02E12,rachel,"Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.",8.6
S02E12,rachel,And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.,8.6
S02E12,joey,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.",8.6
S02E12,rachel,Does anybody need anything?,8.6

S02E12,rachel,That is so unfair.,8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.",8.6
S02E12,ross,"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.",8.6

S02E12,monica,What did you say?,8.6
S02E12,chandler,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?",8.6

S02E12,rachel,"Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?",8.6
S02E12,phoebe,"Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...",8.6
S02E12,monica,"Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.",8.6
S02E12,rachel,That is the most ridiculous.,8.6

S02E14,joey,"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.",9.4
S02E14,chandler,"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?",9.4
S02E14,joey,"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",9.4
S02E14,chandler,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]",9.4
S02E14,joey,"You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]",9.4
S02E14,chandler,"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]",9.4

S02E14,phoebe,Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.,9.4
S02E14,chandler,"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]",9.4

S02E14,joey,Get out.,9.4
S02E14,chandler,"No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.",9.4
S02E14,joey,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",9.4
S02E14,chandler,That's what they'll call us.,9.4

S02E15,monica,Stop sending food to our apartment.,8.9
S02E15,ross,"Well, why're you all dressed up?",8.9

S02E15,rachel,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. [they kiss]",8.9

S02E15,rachel,This time it's not so funny.,8.9
S02E15,rachel,"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",8.9

S02E15,ross,I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.,8.9
S02E15,rachel,What?,8.9
S02E15,ross,We're not alone. [A church youth group is outside the display watching them],8.9
S02E15,joey,Is that the fire alarm?,8.9
S02E15,chandler,"Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.",8.9
S02E15,joey,Cool.,8.9
S02E16,joey,Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?,8.6
S02E16,chandler,"That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,Waaa-aaah.,8.6
S02E16,joey,What?,8.6
S02E16,chandler,The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.,8.6
S02E16,joey,"Yeah, so.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?,8.6
S02E16,joey,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.",8.6
S02E16,joey,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",8.6
S02E16,chandler,Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.,8.6
S02E16,joey,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,Hey.,8.6

S02E16,rachel,"[enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,Okey-doke.,8.6
S02E16,monica,I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.,8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?",8.6
S02E16,rachel,"Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.",8.6
S02E16,joey,"Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?",8.6
S02E16,joey,So where you gettin' it?,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters],8.6
S02E16,ross,What? What's on your shoulder?,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.",8.6
S02E16,ross,"A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.",8.6
S02E16,rachel,"Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?",8.6
S02E16,ross,"No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?",8.6

S02E16,joey,"Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"No, I think you should tell them.",8.6
S02E16,monica,"No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.",8.6
S02E16,ross,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",8.6
S02E16,ross,"Alright, shall we?",8.6
S02E16,monica,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",8.6
S02E16,ross,"Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.",8.6
S02E16,monica,Happy birthday dad.,8.6
S02E16,ross,Hi ma.,8.6
S02E16,ross,"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.",8.6
S02E16,monica,Are we still on that?,8.6
S02E16,joey,Can you believe this place?,8.6
S02E16,chandler,"I know, this is a great apartment.",8.6
S02E16,joey,"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.",8.6
S02E16,joey,"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",8.6
S02E16,joey,Huh?,8.6
S02E16,joey,"Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"[being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.",8.6
S02E16,ross,"Dad, you really don't want to do that.",8.6
S02E16,ross,"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?",8.6
S02E16,rachel,Well I. . .,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,Here we go.,8.6
S02E16,rachel,[reluctantly] Uh-huh.,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,You're not going?,8.6
S02E16,rachel,Uh-huh.,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?,8.6
S02E16,rachel,"No. Well, yeah, maybe.",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",8.6
S02E16,rachel,What's 1922?,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",8.6
S02E16,rachel,"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .",8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",8.6
S02E16,rachel,No.,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,"OK, who is the boss of you?!!",8.6
S02E16,rachel,You?,8.6
S02E16,phoebe,No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!,8.6
S02E16,monica,I'm a twinkie.,8.6
S02E16,monica,"Oh, this is so hard.",8.6
S02E16,monica,Maybe we should just tell your parents first.,8.6
S02E16,monica,"God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",8.6
S02E16,monica,Alright.,8.6
S02E16,joey,Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.,8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.",8.6
S02E16,joey,"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.,8.6
S02E16,joey,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,What?,8.6
S02E16,joey,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",8.6
S02E16,joey,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",8.6
S02E16,chandler,"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",8.6
S02E16,joey,Well that's how I feel.,8.6
S02E16,chandler,Well then maybe you should take it.,8.6
S02E16,joey,Well then maybe I will.,8.6
S02E16,chandler,Fine with me.,8.6
S02E16,joey,"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.",8.6
S02E16,ross,"Mon, Mon, are you OK?",8.6
S02E16,monica,You remember that video I found of mom and dad?,8.6
S02E16,ross,Yeah.,8.6
S02E16,monica,"Well, I just caught the live show.",8.6
S02E16,ross,Eww.,8.6
S02E16,monica,Hey there.,8.6
S02E16,monica,"Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.",8.6
S02E16,ross,Ohh.,8.6
S02E16,ross,"Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Well, uh, he's a doctor.",8.6
S02E16,monica,"No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Mom, it's OK.",8.6
S02E16,ross,I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat],8.6
S02E16,monica,"Dad, I'm the twinkie.",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .",8.6
S02E16,monica,"Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.",8.6

S02E17,rachel,"OK, Phoebs. But what about you?",8.3
S02E17,phoebe,"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",8.3
S02E17,chandler,"Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?",8.3

S02E18,chandler,God that is good TV.,8.5
S02E18,chandler,"Phoebs, play with meeee.",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,Why don't you play with your roommate?,8.5
S02E18,chandler,"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",8.5
S02E18,chandler,"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",8.5
S02E18,chandler,We don't need to remedy that.,8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]",8.5

S02E18,chandler,Well it's not Sean Penn.,8.5

S02E18,phoebe,"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",8.5
S02E18,joey,"Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",8.5
S02E18,joey,"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",8.5
S02E18,joey,"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",8.5
S02E18,joey,"They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.",8.5
S02E18,joey,"No. No way, I'm not signing that.",8.5
S02E18,joey,How can they do this to me?,8.5
S02E18,monica,"Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.",8.5
S02E18,ross,G'night.,8.5
S02E18,monica,"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.",8.5
S02E18,monica,"Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",8.5
S02E18,monica,"Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]",8.5
S02E18,monica,"Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.",8.5

S02E18,ross,Really?,8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,Buddy?,8.5
S02E18,chandler,There was no fish when she dropped it off.,8.5
S02E18,chandler,"Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]",8.5
S02E18,monica,Well yeah.,8.5
S02E18,monica,You really ok with it?,8.5
S02E18,monica,"Oh, yay. Ok about that two.",8.5
S02E18,monica,"Well, it just seems like a really small number.",8.5
S02E18,monica,"And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",8.5
S02E18,monica,But you've only slept with two people.,8.5
S02E18,monica,"Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",8.5
S02E18,ross,"Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",8.5
S02E18,ross,"Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.",8.5
S02E18,ross,Knock-knock.,8.5
S02E18,rachel,"But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",8.5
S02E18,ross,Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed],8.5

S02E18,monica,There's only one.,8.5
S02E18,monica,"Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. [shuts the bathroom door]",8.5

S02E18,ross,"What, what oh....[Ross and Rachel go into her room]",8.5
S02E18,monica,"It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,"So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",8.5
S02E18,monica,Why?,8.5
S02E18,chandler,Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.,8.5
S02E18,phoebe,Why would you kill his fish?,8.5
S02E18,chandler,"Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? [they turn on the TV]",8.5
S02E18,ross,Yeah.,8.5

S02E18,chandler,We came over as soon as we saw.,8.5
S02E18,ross,How could you not tell us?,8.5
S02E18,joey,"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.",8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.",8.5
S02E18,joey,"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",8.5
S02E18,joey,"Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",8.5
S02E18,phoebe,"Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",8.5
S02E18,monica,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,It's gonna be ok. You know that?,8.5
S02E18,joey,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",8.5
S02E18,chandler,I'm sorry man.,8.5
S02E18,rachel,"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.",8.5
S02E18,joey,"No, that means nothin to me.",8.5

S02E19,monica,"Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.",8.6
S02E19,joey,"Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.",8.6
S02E19,monica,Cache? Jaunty?,8.6
S02E19,joey,Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,Hey.,8.6

S02E19,rachel,"Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?",8.6
S02E19,monica,Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",8.6
S02E19,rachel,Men just take out wind?,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",8.6
S02E19,rachel,Wow.,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,Yeah.,8.6
S02E19,rachel,"Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.",8.6
S02E19,monica,"It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.",8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.",8.6
S02E19,monica,No.,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"No, 'cause he's yummy.",8.6
S02E19,monica,Yes. But all the other ones.,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",8.6
S02E19,joey,Anybody want a croan.,8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'",8.6
S02E19,joey,"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",8.6
S02E19,joey,"No, can we get back to me?",8.6
S02E19,joey,Alright. Cab driver number two?,8.6
S02E19,joey,But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?,8.6
S02E19,joey,"But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.",8.6
S02E19,joey,I'm sorry. See ya.,8.6
S02E19,rachel,"Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.",8.6
S02E19,monica,Isn't it.,8.6
S02E19,rachel,"Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.",8.6
S02E19,phoebe,I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.,8.6
S02E19,ross,Hey you guys.,8.6
S02E19,monica,Hey.,8.6
S02E19,ross,"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.",8.6
S02E19,rachel,NO!,8.6
S02E19,ross,No?,8.6
S02E19,rachel,"No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?",8.6
S02E19,ross,Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.,8.6
S02E19,rachel,"No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.",8.6
S02E19,monica,You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?,8.6
S02E19,ross,"Excuse me, your, your, your wind?",8.6
S02E19,rachel,"Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?",8.6
S02E19,ross,"You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.",8.6
S02E19,rachel,"Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.",8.6
S02E19,phoebe,"Um-um, um-um.",8.6
S02E19,rachel,"You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!",8.6
S02E19,joey,What is it?,8.6
S02E19,ross,"I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.",8.6

S02E20,rachel,Uh-huh.,8.2
S02E20,ross,"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want.

S02E20,phoebe,It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.,8.2
S02E20,monica,"So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.",8.2
S02E20,phoebe,"Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.",8.2
S02E20,phoebe,"Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.",8.2
S02E20,chandler,"[runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.",8.2
S02E20,monica,There's a game?,8.2
S02E20,chandler,"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Oh, then go Vassar.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Ok, then just go.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",8.2
S02E20,phoebe,Sure.,8.2
S02E20,monica,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",8.2
S02E20,phoebe,Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,[enters] Aghh.,8.2
S02E20,phoebe,Me too. [leaves],8.2
S02E20,monica,I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"[enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,What was the book?,8.2
S02E20,ross,The big book of childrens' names.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",8.2
S02E20,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,"But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",8.2
S02E20,ross,Ok fine.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,Thank you.,8.2
S02E20,ross,We're not done.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,I didn't know that.,8.2
S02E20,ross,"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Fine, I will.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Good, 'cause I love you.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,Oh yeah.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,Well I love you too.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Well that's the first time we've said that.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,Yes it is.,8.2
S02E20,ross,"Well, I'm gonna kiss you.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,Well you better.,8.2
S02E20,phoebe,Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.,8.2
S02E20,monica,Did you like it?,8.2
S02E20,phoebe,"Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",8.2
S02E20,phoebe,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.\""",8.2
S02E20,chandler,Kick save and... denied.,8.2
S02E20,joey,Man you are incredible.,8.2
S02E20,chandler,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"[enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.",8.2
S02E20,monica,[grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?,8.2
S02E20,chandler,"See, that's why we don't let her play.",8.2
S02E20,monica,Um-hmm.,8.2
S02E20,chandler,"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.",8.2
S02E20,joey,"Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.",8.2
S02E20,joey,"No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.",8.2
S02E20,joey,Oh yeah.,8.2
S02E20,chandler,No.,8.2
S02E20,joey,Nooooo.,8.2
S02E20,chandler,"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.",8.2
S02E20,chandler,"No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.",8.2
S02E20,monica,Nighty-nite.,8.2
S02E20,chandler,You're not a dad. You're not a dad.,8.2
S02E20,joey,Not a dad.,8.2
S02E20,chandler,I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back],8.2
S02E20,monica,[her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?,8.2
S02E20,monica,"Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.",8.2
S02E20,monica,"Yeah, well they suck too.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.",8.2
S02E20,ross,[doorbell buzzes] Hello.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room],8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. [finishes the diaper] There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Wha, what?",8.2
S02E20,rachel,Ben just said hi.,8.2
S02E20,ross,"What, the word hi?",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,Guess what. Ben just said his first word.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Something about hi.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,"You know, actually it's more like, hi.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,Hi.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,Hi.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,Hi.,8.2
S02E20,ross,"Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.",8.2
S02E20,rachel,Take care.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Bye Ben.,8.2
S02E20,rachel,"Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.",8.2
S02E20,ross,"Alright, alright, ok. Bye.",8.2
S02E20,ross,Bye.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Bye.,8.2
S02E20,ross,Bye.,8.2
S02E20,phoebe,"[pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]",8.2
S02E20,phoebe,"Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",8.2
S02E21,monica,"'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Ok honey, you really need a job.",8.2
S02E21,ross,"Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.",8.2
S02E21,monica,Really.,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.",8.2
S02E21,ross,"On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.,8.2
S02E21,monica,His indian name?,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.,8.2
S02E21,ross,Freakish.,8.2
S02E21,monica,Wow.,8.2
S02E21,joey,Freaky.,8.2
S02E21,monica,"Weird, weird.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",8.2
S02E21,monica,Why?,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Man, I am so beat.",8.2
S02E21,ross,Oh yeah.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?",8.2
S02E21,ross,Yeah alright.,8.2
S02E21,ross,"Oh, sorry we didn't know.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"No actually, I was just going for colorful.",8.2
S02E21,ross,"Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,What just happened?,8.2
S02E21,chandler,"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?",8.2
S02E21,chandler,No?,8.2
S02E21,ross,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",8.2
S02E21,ross,"Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Hey, how'd the interview go?",8.2
S02E21,monica,It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?,8.2
S02E21,rachel,So don't do it.,8.2
S02E21,monica,How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.,8.2
S02E21,joey,"Monica, relax, go get a beer.",8.2
S02E21,monica,I don't want a beer.,8.2
S02E21,joey,Who said it was for you?,8.2
S02E21,rachel,What's the matter with you?,8.2
S02E21,chandler,The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,Noo.,8.2
S02E21,joey,You're kiddin'.,8.2
S02E21,ross,"It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,Oohhh.,8.2
S02E21,ross,Hi.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug],8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.",8.2
S02E21,monica,"[seeing TV] Hey, I went up.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,What?,8.2
S02E21,monica,"My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.",8.2
S02E21,joey,Do what?,8.2
S02E21,monica,Put all my money in me.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.",8.2
S02E21,monica,"What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls...[on the phone] Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"We love you, we're here for you.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Yeah good luck, good luck.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,Thanks. [gets out of the cab],8.2
S02E21,joey,"Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Ohh, what is in that?",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"[a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,Run Phoebe run.,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?",8.2
S02E21,rachel,Are you kidding me?,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.] Ok, alright, we have a problem.",8.2
S02E21,joey,Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the window]",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Hey, hey, hey no.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. [dog ignores the sandwich] Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,Are you crazy?,8.2
S02E21,joey,"Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway through it.] Ahhh.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,Hey.,8.2
S02E21,ross,What?,8.2
S02E21,chandler,Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?,8.2
S02E21,ross,Do you say this stuff to girls?,8.2
S02E21,ross,"You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.",8.2
S02E21,ross,"Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.",8.2
S02E21,ross,Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.,8.2
S02E21,ross,"Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]",8.2
S02E21,chandler,Don't play with his things.,8.2
S02E21,ross,I know.,8.2
S02E21,ross,"Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?",8.2
S02E21,chandler,You had to ask.,8.2
S02E21,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S02E21,ross,"Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,I think you played the Gunther card too soon.,8.2
S02E21,joey,"Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Yeah, I don't know.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,What's the matter?,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Ok, thanks. Sorry, again",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,[innocently] What was that?,8.2
S02E21,joey,"Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.",8.2
S02E21,monica,I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,Time is money my friend?,8.2
S02E21,joey,"Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'",8.2
S02E21,monica,"Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,How did you make $17.,8.2
S02E21,monica,"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",8.2
S02E21,joey,How come those?,8.2
S02E21,monica,"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"What happened to uh, MEG.?",8.2
S02E21,monica,"MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.",8.2
S02E21,joey,That is so not my motto.,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,[enters] Hey.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",8.2
S02E21,joey,Good.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Oh, thank God.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,"Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]",8.2
S02E21,monica,DON'T...be too long with the phone.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.,8.2
S02E21,joey,[dials the phone] It's a woman.,8.2
S02E21,phoebe,So talk to her.,8.2
S02E21,joey,"[in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]",8.2
S02E21,rachel,Why the voice.,8.2
S02E21,joey,[in the voice] Hard to say.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,Your cappucino sir.,8.2
S02E21,ross,Thank you.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.,8.2
S02E21,ross,Absolutely.,8.2
S02E21,ross,How come it's not mixing with the water?,8.2
S02E21,joey,"[walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,Ok.,8.2
S02E21,ross,No.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,No?,8.2
S02E21,ross,"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",8.2
S02E21,joey,"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",8.2
S02E21,ross,"Yeah, sure.",8.2
S02E21,joey,By someone besides Monica?,8.2
S02E21,ross,"No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",8.2
S02E21,monica,[Opens the door] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,What?,8.2
S02E21,monica,"Hi, welcome home. [pulls Rachel inside] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.",8.2
S02E21,rachel,For what?,8.2
S02E21,monica,I've gotta get back in the game.,8.2
S02E21,rachel,"Why, when did you get out of the game?",8.2
S02E21,monica,"I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.",8.2

S02E21,chandler,"Alright, let's do this.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",8.2
S02E21,ross,Whad'ya mean?,8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.",8.2
S02E21,chandler,Ok. [reaches in his pocket],8.2
S02E21,chandler,Ok.,8.2
S02E21,ross,"Before I forget, are we hitting faces?",8.2
S02E21,ross,"Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.",8.2

S02E21,ross,Alright.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Ok so, can I have my hat back?",8.2
S02E21,chandler,Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls behind the couch],8.2
S02E21,rachel,Look at her.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,Hi Monica.,8.2
S02E21,joey,"He-he-he, how's it goin'?",8.2
S02E21,phoebe,Hey nice boobs.,8.2
S02E21,chandler,"Guys guys, check this out.",8.2
S02E21,joey,Excellent.,8.2
S02E22,monica,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.",9
S02E22,monica,What?,9
S02E22,ross,Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,9
S02E22,monica,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?,9
S02E22,ross,Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,9
S02E22,joey,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,9
S02E22,ross,Yeah.,9
S02E22,phoebe,"Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",9
S02E22,monica,"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",9
S02E22,monica,"Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.",9
S02E22,ross,"I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.",9
S02E22,joey,"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",9
S02E22,phoebe,Why not her?,9
S02E22,joey,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",9
S02E22,chandler,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,9
S02E22,monica,Joey that is horriable.,9
S02E22,joey,"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"I'm sorry, I didn't know.",9
S02E22,joey,"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",9
S02E22,ross,"Hi honey, how did it go?",9
S02E22,rachel,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",9
S02E22,rachel,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",9
S02E22,monica,So what happened?,9
S02E22,rachel,"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",9
S02E22,monica,"Well, how bout just her mom?",9
S02E22,chandler,Why her mom?,9
S02E22,monica,Cause I already invited her.,9
S02E22,phoebe,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",9
S02E22,joey,"Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.",9
S02E22,chandler,Excuse me?,9
S02E22,monica,It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,9
S02E22,joey,"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",9
S02E22,monica,[answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?,9
S02E22,monica,"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",9
S02E22,monica,"No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",9
S02E22,chandler,"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",9
S02E22,monica,Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,9
S02E22,chandler,"So, basically just a Chinese guy.",9
S02E22,joey,"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",9
S02E22,monica,"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Yes because uh, you look so young.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"And because you're both, you know, white women.",9
S02E22,chandler,"NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"[cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]",9
S02E22,monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",9
S02E22,joey,"[peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",9
S02E22,monica,"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",9
S02E22,monica,Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,9
S02E22,joey,Right this is staging.,9
S02E22,chandler,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",9
S02E22,joey,"[as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]",9
S02E22,chandler,"Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",9
S02E22,monica,Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright that's Ross.,9
S02E22,chandler,"Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]",9
S02E22,rachel,"Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.",9
S02E22,ross,Thanks for being born.,9
S02E22,rachel,"Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.",9
S02E22,ross,"Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.",9
S02E22,rachel,Now I love you even more.,9
S02E22,rachel,"Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.",9
S02E22,rachel,"Wow you, you. I had no idea.",9
S02E22,ross,Really?,9
S02E22,rachel,"No, I knew.",9
S02E22,ross,All right.,9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.",9
S02E22,ross,What?,9
S02E22,rachel,What?,9
S02E22,monica,"Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.",9

S02E22,chandler,"Well, we could count again.",9
S02E22,rachel,I can't believe this is happening.,9
S02E22,ross,"You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",9
S02E22,rachel,I do.,9
S02E22,ross,That's who.,9
S02E22,chandler,"Look, are you gonna be ok?",9
S02E22,rachel,"Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Well, actually just one birthday flan.",9
S02E22,rachel,What?,9
S02E22,chandler,"It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.",9
S02E22,joey,Quick volleyball question.,9
S02E22,chandler,Volleyball.,9
S02E22,joey,"Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?",9
S02E22,chandler,"Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Ok, that's me. [runs back]",9
S02E22,rachel,"Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.",9
S02E22,ross,"Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?",9
S02E22,rachel,"Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.",9
S02E22,monica,"Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.",9
S02E22,ross,"Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?",9
S02E22,ross,I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.,9
S02E22,monica,"Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. [she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?",9
S02E22,monica,"No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Listen if you wanna go, just go.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Alright, I can get you out.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.",9
S02E22,ross,"Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?",9
S02E22,ross,"Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.",9
S02E22,ross,Cool.,9
S02E22,ross,I know.,9
S02E22,ross,"Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.",9
S02E22,ross,"Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?",9
S02E22,ross,No. no.,9
S02E22,ross,"No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.",9
S02E22,ross,All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses],9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?",9
S02E22,monica,"What? [she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go] I don't see anything.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Great, I'm seeing water rings again.",9
S02E22,ross,Mine.,9
S02E22,ross,"Um-hmm. [puts them on] I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.",9
S02E22,rachel,Well those are very popular frames.,9
S02E22,ross,Neil Sedaka wears them.,9
S02E22,rachel,"Yeah, like a chimney.",9
S02E22,ross,"Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process. Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he comes face to face with Mr. Greene]",9
S02E22,ross,Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the earpieces for you.,9
S02E22,ross,"[pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.",9
S02E22,phoebe,There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.,9
S02E22,phoebe,Everything you've heard is true.,9
S02E22,monica,"Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.",9
S02E22,monica,"You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?",9
S02E22,phoebe,"[enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.",9
S02E22,monica,Phoebe.,9
S02E22,phoebe,"Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.",9
S02E22,monica,"Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... [volleyball hits her in the head from behind]",9
S02E22,rachel,You want me to see a therapist?,9
S02E22,rachel,"Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.",9
S02E22,rachel,"Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.",9
S02E22,chandler,"[running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",9
S02E22,rachel,"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",9
S02E22,chandler,"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",9
S02E22,rachel,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",9
S02E22,chandler,Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,9
S02E22,rachel,"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",9
S02E22,chandler,"I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]",9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.",9
S02E22,monica,Ok will do. So glad you came.,9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.",9
S02E22,rachel,Oh ok.,9
S02E22,rachel,Ok.,9
S02E22,joey,"Ahh, you drive safe.",9
S02E22,ross,I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross in] How are you doing?,9
S02E22,chandler,"Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?",9
S02E22,chandler,"Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",9
S02E22,joey,"Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.",9
S02E22,monica,Thank you.,9
S02E22,monica,"Ok everybody, it's time for flan.",9
S02E22,chandler,"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.",9
S02E22,joey,Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.,9
S02E22,monica,"Ok, that's enough.",9
S02E22,phoebe,"Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.",9
S02E22,rachel,"Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.",9
S02E23,rachel,"Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.",8.1
S02E23,monica,"Oh, I ordered mine first.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...",8.1
S02E23,monica,Give it to me.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,No.,8.1
S02E23,monica,Give it to me.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]",8.1
S02E23,monica,"[She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.],8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"[enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",8.1
S02E23,monica,"[Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",8.1
S02E23,rachel,You went out with a guy in the Navy?,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",8.1
S02E23,rachel,"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?",8.1
S02E23,monica,That'll teach you to lick my muffin.,8.1
S02E23,ross,[enters] Hiii.,8.1
S02E23,joey,"Oh no, what happened?",8.1
S02E23,ross,"Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.",8.1
S02E23,ross,"Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.",8.1
S02E23,rachel,Well I've had it.,8.1
S02E23,joey,"Yeah, I've had it.",8.1
S02E23,monica,Had it.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,Had it.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!",8.1
S02E23,monica,"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",8.1
S02E23,monica,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,8.1
S02E23,monica,Just waiting for you sweetie.,8.1
S02E23,monica,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",8.1
S02E23,monica,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.",8.1
S02E23,monica,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",8.1
S02E23,monica,I'm just easing you in.,8.1
S02E23,monica,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",8.1
S02E23,monica,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",8.1
S02E23,joey,But don't you need experience for a job like that?,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.,8.1
S02E23,joey,Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?,8.1
S02E23,rachel,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.",8.1
S02E23,monica,"You look fabulous honey, you really do.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]",8.1
S02E23,rachel,"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"I, I, I'm hideous.",8.1
S02E23,monica,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,Come in.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Hey Ryan, what's up?",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Ohh, ohh.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",8.1
S02E23,joey,Hey.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",8.1
S02E23,joey,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,Well there you go.,8.1
S02E23,joey,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",8.1
S02E23,chandler,Weird world. Your kids?,8.1
S02E23,joey,I figure my character has kids.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,8.1
S02E23,joey,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,That you don't stop talking about it.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,No.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,Give it.,8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]",8.1
S02E23,phoebe,"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",8.1
S02E23,rachel,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",8.1
S02E23,ross,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",8.1
S02E23,joey,What a phony.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",8.1
S02E23,joey,Sir.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.,8.1
S02E23,joey,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",8.1
S02E23,joey,This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Uh, if you say so sir.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Joseph's good, isn't he?",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Well, I'm going to kill you.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,Why?,8.1
S02E23,joey,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",8.1
S02E23,monica,This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,8.1
S02E23,monica,It's for their own good.,8.1
S02E23,monica,"Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?",8.1
S02E23,monica,Very good.,8.1
S02E23,monica,You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.,8.1
S02E23,monica,I'm gonna set them to my time.,8.1
S02E23,monica,"No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?",8.1
S02E23,monica,"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.",8.1
S02E23,monica,No. See you don't understand.,8.1
S02E23,monica,No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.,8.1
S02E23,monica,Oh yeah.,8.1
S02E23,monica,"Alright, well tell me one of yours.",8.1
S02E23,monica,What if they get mixed up?,8.1
S02E23,monica,"You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.",8.1
S02E23,joey,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,8.1
S02E23,joey,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",8.1
S02E23,joey,Karen.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",8.1
S02E23,joey,Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",8.1
S02E23,joey,Really?,8.1
S02E23,chandler,"No freakshow, she's fictional.",8.1
S02E23,joey,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",8.1
S02E23,chandler,Thank you.,8.1
S02E23,joey,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]",8.1

S02E24,joey,All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.,8.2
S02E24,joey,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",8.2

S02E24,ross,"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.  Or you just do it.",8.2
S02E24,joey,"I did do it, I'm a professional.",8.2
S02E24,monica,Then what's the problem?,8.2
S02E24,joey,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.",8.2

S02E24,joey,Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?,8.2

S02E24,rachel,"Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

S03E02,chandler,You're in my seat.,9
S03E02,joey,How is this your seat?,9
S03E02,chandler,'Cause I was sitting there.,9
S03E02,joey,But then you left.,9
S03E02,chandler,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.",9
S03E02,joey,"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.",9
S03E02,chandler,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.",9
S03E02,joey,"Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...",9
S03E02,ross,"You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..",9
S03E02,chandler,"All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal.  GET UP!!",9
S03E02,monica,Hi.,9
S03E02,monica,"Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!",9
S03E02,phoebe,All right all ready.,9
S03E02,monica,"Ooh, are you gonna do magic?",9
S03E02,ross,"That's, that's funny. Change!",9
S03E02,monica,Hang on a second I just got in.,9
S03E02,ross,"Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.",9
S03E02,phoebe,"We could not, would not want to wait.",9
S03E02,ross,"Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.",9
S03E02,monica,Has somebody been drinking my fat?,9
S03E02,rachel,does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?,9
S03E02,phoebe,"I don't know, you might be the first one.",9
S03E02,monica,"Rach, did you check the machine?",9
S03E02,rachel,"Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.",9
S03E02,joey,All right! You can have the chair.,9
S03E02,chandler,Really!,9
S03E02,joey,"Oh my, would you look at that!",9
S03E02,phoebe,Is that too spooky?,9
S03E02,ross,\Hi Rach,9
S03E02,rachel,What?!,9
S03E02,ross,Nevermind.,9
S03E02,monica,Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!,9
S03E02,ross,"It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?",9
S03E02,monica,"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?",9
S03E02,chandler,"Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.",9
S03E02,ross,"Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?",9
S03E02,monica,Huh?,9
S03E02,ross,"I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go.",9
S03E02,chandler,"You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here.",9
S03E02,phoebe,Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!,9
S03E02,joey,I'm so sorry.,9
S03E02,phoebe,What am I gonna do?,9
S03E02,ross,"No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.",9
S03E02,monica,"If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.",9
S03E02,chandler,Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.,9
S03E02,monica,"So, should I call him back?",9
S03E02,chandler,"All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo, comfortable.",9
S03E02,joey,"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.",9
S03E02,chandler,All right!,9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.",9
S03E02,chandler,"All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!",9
S03E02,rachel,"Pheebs, what happened?",9
S03E02,phoebe,Hummus. I got the hummus.,9
S03E02,rachel,"Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?",9
S03E02,phoebe,That won't go with this dress though.,9
S03E02,rachel,"No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.",9
S03E02,ross,"No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.",9
S03E02,rachel,"Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?",9
S03E02,monica,I called him.,9
S03E02,monica,"Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.",9
S03E02,monica,"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.",9
S03E02,joey,"Monica, how are you gonna do that?",9
S03E02,monica,I know the code to his answering machine.,9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.",9
S03E02,joey,"Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'",9
S03E02,monica,\Hi,9
S03E02,joey,"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.",9
S03E02,joey,Now she sounded breezy.,9
S03E02,monica,He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.,9
S03E02,phoebe,"Monica, you don't know that.",9
S03E02,monica,"Well, who's voice was that?",9
S03E02,chandler,"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.",9
S03E02,monica,"Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?",9
S03E02,ross,"Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.",9
S03E02,monica,It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.,9
S03E02,rachel,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!",9
S03E02,ross,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?",9
S03E02,rachel,"Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.",9
S03E02,ross,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.",9
S03E02,chandler,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, \Get out of my chair",9
S03E02,joey,Okay.,9
S03E02,chandler,What are you doing?,9
S03E02,joey,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.",9
S03E02,chandler,The cushions are the essence of the chair!,9
S03E02,joey,That's right! I'm taking the essence.,9
S03E02,chandler,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.",9
S03E02,ross,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.",9
S03E02,rachel,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.",9
S03E02,ross,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.",9
S03E02,rachel,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!",9
S03E02,rachel,"Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!",9
S03E02,ross,"Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?",9
S03E02,rachel,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.",9
S03E02,chandler,We used them as pillows when we went camping.,9
S03E02,ross,What?,9
S03E02,chandler,The sheep.,9
S03E02,ross,"Hey, what you do on your own time...",9
S03E02,joey,Where's my underwear?!,9
S03E02,ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?",9
S03E02,chandler,He took my essence!,9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?",9
S03E02,joey,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.",9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?",9
S03E02,joey,It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.,9
S03E02,chandler,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.",9
S03E02,joey,"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.",9
S03E02,chandler,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?",9
S03E02,joey,"Hey, opposite, is opposite!",9
S03E02,chandler,He's got nothing!,9
S03E02,phoebe,"Okay, I'm ready.",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'",9
S03E02,chandler,What are you supporting?,9
S03E02,phoebe,Duh!! Christmas!,9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!",9
S03E02,rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?",9
S03E02,ross,"Just, just, just pick one!",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?",9
S03E02,rachel,"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?",9
S03E02,ross,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.",9
S03E02,rachel,But I...,9
S03E02,ross,"No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.",9
S03E02,rachel,All right.,9
S03E02,ross,Thank you!,9
S03E02,monica,"Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.",9
S03E02,ross,"It was, it was her voice.",9
S03E02,chandler,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.",9
S03E02,monica,Okay. That was her right?,9
S03E02,phoebe,Definitely.,9
S03E02,monica,"See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.",9
S03E02,ross,Yay!,9
S03E02,phoebe,"I'll get it, okay.  Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.",9
S03E02,monica,"Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....",9
S03E02,chandler,"You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?",9
S03E02,monica,That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.,9
S03E02,ross,"No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.",9
S03E02,monica,"Okay, fine.",9
S03E02,chandler,"They got a phone in there, right?",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Okay, we're on it. We're on it.",9
S03E02,ross,"Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.",9
S03E02,rachel,I'm not gonna gooo.,9
S03E02,ross,You're not going to go.,9
S03E02,rachel,"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.",9
S03E02,ross,"How, how, um how can you not be going?",9
S03E02,rachel,"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.",9
S03E02,ross,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity...",9
S03E02,rachel,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.",9
S03E02,ross,"Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.",9
S03E02,rachel,It's fine.,9
S03E02,ross,"No, but, your-your mad.",9
S03E02,rachel,I'm not mad.,9
S03E02,ross,No.,9
S03E02,rachel,I'm just not going.,9
S03E02,ross,Your not going.,9
S03E02,rachel,Right.,9
S03E02,ross,Okay. You know that I-I have to go.,9
S03E02,rachel,"Um, hum.",9
S03E02,ross,Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.',9
S03E02,rachel,No.,9
S03E02,ross,"No, because your not upset.",9
S03E02,rachel,Right.,9
S03E02,ross,About the yelling.,9
S03E02,rachel,"Right, and the humiliating.",9
S03E02,ross,"Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.",9
S03E02,rachel,"Um, hum.",9
S03E02,ross,We're good.,9
S03E02,rachel,Right.,9
S03E02,ross,Okay. Honey?,9
S03E02,rachel,"Yes, Ross.",9
S03E02,ross,I love you.,9
S03E02,phoebe,She's just getting dressed.,9
S03E02,chandler,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?,9
S03E02,joey,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",9
S03E02,chandler,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!,9
S03E02,joey,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,9
S03E02,chandler,Oooo-ooh!,9
S03E02,joey,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.",9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!",9
S03E02,chandler,"Jeez, what a baby.",9
S03E02,joey,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.",9
S03E02,ross,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.",9
S03E02,joey,You could drink the fat.,9
S03E02,ross,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.",9
S03E02,rachel,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.",9
S03E02,ross,What?,9
S03E02,rachel,I think you should drink the fat.,9
S03E02,joey,Yaaaay!,9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.",9
S03E02,phoebe,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.",9
S03E02,ross,"I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.",9
S03E02,rachel,"No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!",9
S03E02,ross,You will?!,9
S03E02,rachel,"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?",9
S03E02,ross,"Well, yeah.",9
S03E02,rachel,You were gonna drink the fat.,9
S03E02,joey,Let's see what else he'll do!,9
S03E02,ross,"You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!",9
S03E02,chandler,Stop it. Stop it!,9
S03E02,phoebe,"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!",9
S03E02,monica,Not any more!,9
S03E02,monica,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.",9
S03E02,monica,"Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!",9
S03E02,monica,\Hi,9
S03E02,phoebe,How did you do that?,9
S03E02,monica,I don't know!,9
S03E02,monica,Noooo!!!!,9
S03E02,ross,"Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!",9
S03E02,monica,Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.,9
S03E02,phoebe,"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.",9
S03E02,ross,"Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!",9
S03E02,rachel,"And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds.",9
S03E02,ross,So we're a little late.,9
S03E02,rachel,"Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way....",9
S03E02,ross,What?,9
S03E02,rachel,"I'm going commando, too.",9
S03E02,ross,Awwww!!!,9
S03E02,ross,Wow! What a pleasure.,9
S03E02,chandler,Excuse me. Hi.,9
S03E02,chandler,"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.",9
S03E02,chandler,"I mean, I was sitting there.",9
S03E02,chandler,"But, I never left the room!",9
S03E02,chandler,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear.",9
S03E03,joey,WHOAA!!,8.1
S03E03,chandler,"See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",8.1
S03E03,ross,Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?,8.1
S03E03,monica,Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.,8.1
S03E03,rachel,I didn't know there were docks.,8.1
S03E03,joey,Hey.,8.1
S03E03,chandler,Hey.,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Aww, is it broken?",8.1
S03E03,joey,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,8.1
S03E03,joey,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.",8.1
S03E03,joey,What is this? Fruit?,8.1
S03E03,rachel,Monica's making jam.,8.1
S03E03,joey,"Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",8.1
S03E03,chandler,Because the kids need new shoes.,8.1
S03E03,monica,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.",8.1
S03E03,joey,This will just be my batch.,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,What?,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh, you're not a dingus.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Wait,  you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Okay.  Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,Mon?,8.1
S03E03,ross,Mon?,8.1
S03E03,rachel,'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.',8.1
S03E03,ross,"Wait a minute, look.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,What?,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Look, look, look.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"What, what, what?",8.1
S03E03,ross,It's an empty apartment.,8.1
S03E03,rachel,Oooh.,8.1
S03E03,ross,We're all alone in an empty apartment.,8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes",8.1
S03E03,ross,There it is.,8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.",8.1
S03E03,ross,Hey.,8.1
S03E03,chandler,Do I look fat?,8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",8.1
S03E03,ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?",8.1
S03E03,rachel,Nooo!,8.1
S03E03,ross,And it works both ways.,8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.",8.1
S03E03,ross,"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"That's easy, baggage claim.",8.1
S03E03,ross,"Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",8.1

S03E03,chandler,Yeah.,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Okay, the old hug and roll.",8.1
S03E03,ross,Yep.,8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Okay, one question.",8.1
S03E03,ross,Shoot.,8.1
S03E03,chandler,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?,8.1
S03E03,joey,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,8.1
S03E03,rachel,You're so pretty.,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,Hi!,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",8.1
S03E03,joey,You talked to him. Are you crazy?,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",8.1
S03E03,ross,"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",8.1
S03E03,joey,NA,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.",8.1
S03E03,monica,Hey guys.,8.1

S03E03,chandler,"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.",8.1
S03E03,ross,What are you talking about?,8.1
S03E03,monica,I'm talking about me having a baby.,8.1
S03E03,ross,What?,8.1
S03E03,rachel,Are you serious?,8.1
S03E03,monica,"Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.",8.1
S03E03,ross,"Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!",8.1
S03E03,monica,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"That, that's what's stupid.",8.1
S03E03,monica,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,Down at the docks again?,8.1
S03E03,chandler,Night-night.....Janice.,8.1

S03E03,phoebe,Really?,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,Oh.,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh, okay.",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2\",8.1
S03E03,chandler,You mean there's more than one of us.,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....",8.1

S03E03,monica,What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Oh, it's not the ideal way...",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",8.1
S03E03,joey,Check it out!! Jam crackers!,8.1
S03E03,joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule!",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Joey, this is you!",8.1
S03E03,joey,"Let me see.  Oh, right.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,When did you go to a sperm bank?,8.1
S03E03,joey,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?",8.1
S03E03,chandler,And that's how you bought it?,8.1
S03E03,joey,"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.",8.1
S03E03,joey,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,Hellooo!,8.1
S03E03,ross,How's the maniac?,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Phoebe, what are you doing?",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.",8.1
S03E03,ross,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?",8.1
S03E03,chandler,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,What are you saying I should do?,8.1
S03E03,monica,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Thank you, Monica.",8.1
S03E03,joey,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Oh my God, what happened?",8.1
S03E03,rachel,Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.,8.1
S03E03,rachel,Ross's what?,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,Yes? Yes! Oh.,8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?",8.1
S03E03,phoebe,"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.",8.1

S03E03,joey,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.",8.1
S03E03,monica,Really? Why?,8.1
S03E03,joey,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.",8.1
S03E03,monica,Hoyt?,8.1
S03E03,joey,"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.",8.1
S03E03,monica,"Really, is he a swimmer?",8.1
S03E03,joey,He's got the body for it.,8.1
S03E03,monica,I like that.  What?,8.1
S03E03,monica,We do not have one of those signs.,8.1
S03E03,joey,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.",8.1
S03E03,monica,Two girls and a boy?,8.1
S03E03,joey,Yeah!,8.1
S03E03,monica,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.",8.1
S03E03,joey,"Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.",8.1
S03E03,monica,Yeah.,8.1
S03E03,joey,Oh Monica. .,8.1
S03E03,joey,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.",8.1
S03E03,rachel,"Honey, you got a little thing on your...",8.1
S03E03,joey,Did I get it?,8.1
S03E03,rachel,Yeah.,8.1
S03E03,ross,Hello.,8.1
S03E03,rachel,Hello.,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?",8.1
S03E03,chandler,Sure. What's up?,8.1
S03E03,ross,"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Oh, oh! It's on again!",8.1
S03E04,joey,"You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",8.1
S03E04,joey,Aw! There's got to be a better way!,8.1
S03E04,joey,Can we please turn this off?,8.1

S03E04,joey,"Now, I can have milk everyday.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Well, it's official there are no good movies.",8.1
S03E04,monica,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.",8.1
S03E04,joey,Hey!,8.1
S03E04,phoebe,Hey.,8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Hey, man. What's up?",8.1
S03E04,joey,Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!,8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",8.1
S03E04,joey,How is it you?,8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Yep, that's my audition.",8.1
S03E04,monica,"See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,8.1
S03E04,joey,"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .",8.1
S03E04,joey,"What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Hang up, hang up.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",8.1
S03E04,chandler,Is anybody else scared?,8.1
S03E04,phoebe,NA,8.1
S03E04,chandler,Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!,8.1
S03E04,monica,"Oh, now you want a pad.",8.1
S03E04,ross,"There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?",8.1
S03E04,ross,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?",8.1
S03E04,ross,"You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.",8.1
S03E04,ross,"Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?",8.1
S03E04,monica,I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?,8.1
S03E04,joey,I love that movie.,8.1
S03E04,monica,"There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",8.1
S03E04,joey,"I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.,8.1
S03E04,joey,"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.",8.1
S03E04,rachel,What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?,8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",8.1
S03E04,ross,"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",8.1
S03E04,chandler,Noo.,8.1
S03E04,ross,"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.",8.1
S03E04,rachel,Men are unbelievable.,8.1
S03E04,monica,"What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.",8.1
S03E04,monica,"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Hey, you know about that?!",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!",8.1
S03E04,ross,Where there is no fear of commitment.,8.1
S03E04,chandler,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,8.1
S03E04,joey,"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Amazingly, that makes sense.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,You think?,8.1
S03E04,joey,"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Come on baby, come on!",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'",8.1
S03E04,rachel,Very nice touch.,8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Op, went through a tunnel.",8.1
S03E04,rachel,Unbelievable.,8.1
S03E04,joey,Thank you so much.,8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",8.1
S03E04,joey,"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,Two?,8.1
S03E04,joey,"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",8.1
S03E04,joey,"Nooo, four.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,It doesn't scare me!,8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Honey, this will help.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.",8.1
S03E04,monica,That is never good.,8.1
S03E04,chandler,Then I got all needy and clingy.,8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?",8.1
S03E04,chandler,She said she'd call me.,8.1
S03E04,chandler,Oh God.,8.1
S03E04,monica,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.,8.1
S03E04,chandler,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.,8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.",8.1
S03E04,monica,"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Yeah, you do.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"So, you don't think I'm terminal?",8.1
S03E04,monica,"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.",8.1
S03E04,monica,She has to know that your not ready.,8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",8.1
S03E04,rachel,"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",8.1
S03E04,chandler,"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",8.1
S03E04,rachel,Oh.,8.1
S03E04,ross,"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.",8.1
S03E04,rachel,G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?,8.1
S03E04,joey,G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?,8.1
S03E04,ross,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",8.1
S03E04,phoebe,NA,8.1
S03E04,joey,Pheebs! There you are!,8.1
S03E04,phoebe,"No it's not, sorry.",8.1

S03E07,ross,"Yeah, if you’re really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.",8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.",8.3

S03E07,ross,That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",8.3
S03E07,ross,So?,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.",8.3
S03E07,ross,You really serve people sneezers?,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Well um, I don’t.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Thanks again, Dr. Green.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Oh, ah, you don’t need that.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.",8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.",8.3
S03E07,ross,I know.,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Nothing I do means anything, really.",8.3
S03E07,ross,Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.,8.3
S03E07,joey,"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",8.3
S03E07,joey,Hey-hey.,8.3
S03E07,joey,"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",8.3

S03E07,ross,Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",8.3
S03E07,phoebe,"I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",8.3
S03E07,rachel,Um. yeah.,8.3
S03E07,phoebe,I am soo dead.,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’",8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",8.3
S03E07,rachel,"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!",8.3
S03E07,ross,"Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.",8.3

S03E07,joey,"Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.",8.3
S03E07,chandler,You totally screwed him over.,8.3
S03E07,monica,"Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",8.3
S03E07,joey,"Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.",8.3
S03E07,phoebe,"Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.",8.3

S03E07,ross,Argue with that.,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.",8.3
S03E07,ross,I know that!,8.3
S03E07,rachel,"I’m sorry, let her?",8.3
S03E07,ross,"What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.",8.3
S03E07,rachel,No.,8.3
S03E07,ross,"Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?",8.3
S03E07,ross,Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?,8.3

S03E08,phoebe,"No, no, it’s just my tooth.",8.4
S03E08,chandler,All right I’ll have one.,8.4
S03E08,ross,"So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",8.4
S03E08,chandler,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,8.4
S03E08,ross,Why? Why can’t you go to him?,8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",8.4
S03E08,chandler,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.",8.4
S03E08,rachel,"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.",8.4
S03E08,rachel,And all these people actually died?,8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!",8.4
S03E08,ross,"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",8.4
S03E08,ross,"Thanks, Gunther.  Umm, can I get a napkin too?",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,NA,8.4
S03E08,rachel,"Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.",8.4
S03E08,rachel,I promise.,8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",8.4
S03E08,joey,"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",8.4
S03E08,ross,"No, no he’s not.",8.4
S03E08,monica,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",8.4
S03E08,ross,"What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?",8.4
S03E08,joey,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.",8.4
S03E08,rachel,"Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.",8.4
S03E08,joey,"It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him.",8.4
S03E08,joey,Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.,8.4
S03E08,phoebe,"Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......",8.4
S03E08,ross,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",8.4
S03E08,joey,What did they do?,8.4
S03E08,ross,"Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",8.4
S03E08,monica,"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",8.4
S03E08,ross,"Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",8.4
S03E08,rachel,Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?,8.4
S03E08,ross,You? You! Want to watch Ben?,8.4
S03E08,joey,"Hey-hey, Ross?",8.4

S03E08,joey,I’ve got a science question.,8.4
S03E08,ross,Hmm?,8.4
S03E08,joey,"If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?",8.4
S03E08,ross,"Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.",8.4
S03E08,joey,"Hey-hey, I’m not judging.",8.4

S03E08,rachel,"Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him down. Come here, Ben.  How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!",8.4
S03E08,monica,"He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.",8.4
S03E08,rachel,We’re not?!,8.4
S03E08,monica,No we’re not.,8.4
S03E08,rachel,"All right, I like that.",8.4
S03E08,monica,Okay.,8.4

S03E08,joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.",8.4
S03E08,chandler,"That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.",8.4
S03E08,joey,"Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.",8.4
S03E08,chandler,"All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever.",8.4
S03E08,joey,"No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.",8.4

S03E08,joey,"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",8.4
S03E08,monica,It just makes more sense as an ensemble.,8.4
S03E08,rachel,Right.,8.4
S03E08,monica,"Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.",8.4
S03E08,phoebe,No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!,8.4

S03E08,joey,"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?",8.4
S03E08,chandler,"I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?",8.4

S03E09,chandler,That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!,9
S03E09,joey,"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.",9

S03E09,ross,"It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.",9
S03E09,monica,"To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",9
S03E09,ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.",9

S03E09,rachel,"Um, there was a Geller Cup?",9
S03E09,ross,"Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.",9

S03E11,joey,"Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.",8.6

S03E11,rachel,"Yeah, I do.",8.6
S03E11,ross,Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write.  What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?,8.6
S03E11,chandler,"Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",8.6
S03E11,ross,"All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",8.6
S03E11,chandler,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?,8.6
S03E11,ross,Where in Cuba?,8.6

S03E11,joey,"You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",8.6
S03E11,chandler,Where’s Mary-Angela?,8.6
S03E11,joey,She’s right in there.,8.6
S03E11,rachel,"I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.",8.6
S03E11,ross,Bummer.,8.6
S03E11,rachel,"Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",8.6
S03E11,ross,"No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.",8.6
S03E11,monica,"Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",8.6
S03E11,ross,"But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.",8.6
S03E11,monica,"Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",8.6
S03E11,ross,"What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?",8.6
S03E11,rachel,"Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.",8.6
S03E11,ross,"That’s right good things, that-that is what I said.",8.6
S03E11,rachel,"He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",8.6

S03E11,ross,High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.,8.6
S03E11,rachel,"Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!",8.6

S03E11,chandler,"Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.",8.6
S03E11,chandler,"This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?",8.6

S03E11,joey,"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",8.6
S03E11,chandler,"I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",8.6
S03E11,chandler,"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me.  Are ya?",8.6
S03E11,joey,"Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",8.6
S03E11,chandler,"Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",8.6
S03E11,joey,"No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",8.6

S03E11,phoebe,"Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",8.6
S03E11,ross,Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?,8.6
S03E11,ross,Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?,8.6
S03E11,joey,"All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  But, is he a big guy?",8.6
S03E11,ross,"Ah, we’ll all go.",8.6

S03E12,rachel,Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.",8.2

S03E12,ross,It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!,8.2

S03E12,ross,"What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",8.2
S03E12,chandler,Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.,8.2
S03E12,phoebe,"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!",8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",8.2
S03E12,ross,"She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  What am I gonna do?",8.2

S03E12,rachel,"Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.",8.2
S03E12,ross,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.",8.2
S03E12,joey,Mark's a genius!,8.2
S03E12,ross,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.",8.2
S03E12,ross,What am I going to do?,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",8.2
S03E12,ross,I don't know you guys.,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",8.2
S03E12,joey,"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",8.2
S03E12,chandler,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?,8.2
S03E12,rachel,Ohhh! That is soo sweet!,8.2
S03E12,ross,"All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!",8.2
S03E12,ross,What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,8.2
S03E12,rachel,Ross!,8.2
S03E12,ross,I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?!,8.2
S03E12,joey,"So, does that mean the audition is off?",8.2
S03E12,joey,What?!,8.2
S03E12,joey,"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",8.2
S03E12,joey,Bye.,8.2

S03E12,phoebe,Well not exactly like the one in the poem.,8.2
S03E12,monica,What do you mean?,8.2
S03E12,phoebe,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.,8.2
S03E12,monica,"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",8.2
S03E12,monica,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.",8.2
S03E12,monica,You don't even know me...,8.2
S03E12,monica,What?,8.2
S03E12,monica,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",8.2
S03E12,monica,Oh yeah.,8.2
S03E12,joey,"I know, it was the best I could get out of them.",8.2
S03E12,joey,"People, people, people.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,"So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?",8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she's fully dressed, right?",8.2
S03E12,rachel,Right.,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and",8.2
S03E12,ross,Hi.,8.2
S03E12,rachel,Hello.,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.",8.2
S03E12,ross,"I'm sorry, I was an idiot.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,A big idiot.,8.2
S03E12,ross,"A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",8.2
S03E12,ross,"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.",8.2
S03E12,ross,I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?",8.2
S03E12,rachel,Where ya going?,8.2
S03E12,ross,"Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Ohh, with who?",8.2
S03E12,ross,"Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!,8.2
S03E12,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S03E12,rachel,You have a play date with a stripper?!,8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Man, I gotta get a kid.",8.2
S03E12,ross,"Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?",8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Sure, is she married?",8.2
S03E12,ross,"Ahh, no.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,Oh.,8.2
S03E12,ross,Are you jealous?,8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?",8.2
S03E12,ross,You are totally jealous.,8.2
S03E12,rachel,"I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...",8.2
S03E12,ross,"Honey, I love you too.",8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",8.2
S03E12,ross,What?,8.2
S03E12,ross,Huh.,8.2
S03E12,rachel,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.",8.2
S03E12,chandler,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",8.2
S03E13,monica,Hi.,8.2
S03E13,monica,Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.",8.2
S03E13,monica,Oh my God. Richard?  Hi!,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Wow! Your lip went bald.  Hey, thanks.",8.2
S03E13,monica,Right.,8.2
S03E13,monica,What?,8.2
S03E13,monica,"That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",8.2
S03E13,monica,It’s good to see you too.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.",8.2
S03E13,monica,Yeah.,8.2
S03E13,monica,Me too.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"No, I just I think that it’s too soon.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Yeah, baby!",8.2
S03E13,ross,What are you doing?,8.2
S03E13,chandler,Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?,8.2
S03E13,ross,No thanks. I’m 29.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Oh my God, I gotta go to work!",8.2
S03E13,ross,"Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Oh come on, not again.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,"I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?",8.2
S03E13,ross,Hmm.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...,8.2
S03E13,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Right.,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,Hi.,8.2
S03E13,joey,Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.",8.2
S03E13,ross,And what are you going to do for him?,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,I’m going to let him.,8.2
S03E13,ross,Okay.,8.2
S03E13,joey,Cool.,8.2
S03E13,monica,Morning.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Somebody got in late last night.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Yeah well, I ran into Richard.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,When did this happen?,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",8.2
S03E13,ross,"So, are you gonna see him again?",8.2
S03E13,monica,Tomorrow night.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.",8.2
S03E13,ross,Naked friends.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Hey.,8.2
S03E13,joey,Hey.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Do you have any ice?,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",8.2
S03E13,joey,I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Hmm.  Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,"But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,How often do you read it?,8.2
S03E13,joey,Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women.",8.2
S03E13,joey,"All right, you got it.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,All right.,8.2
S03E13,joey,Okay.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Yeah.,8.2
S03E13,joey,"How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Oh, hey.",8.2
S03E13,ross,Hey.,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,". That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.",8.2
S03E13,ross,Oh.,8.2
S03E13,chandler,"So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,I’ll have coffee.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Yeah, make that three.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?",8.2
S03E13,ross,"Okay.  What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?",8.2
S03E13,chandler,Robert’s coming out.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?",8.2
S03E13,chandler,No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.,8.2
S03E13,ross,What?!,8.2
S03E13,chandler,The man is showing brain.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Are you sure?  I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....",8.2
S03E13,ross,Okay.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary",8.2
S03E13,chandler,Wellll?,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!",8.2
S03E13,chandler,What do we do? What do we do?,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,Like an eclipse.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.",8.2
S03E13,monica,You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.,8.2
S03E13,monica,Oops.,8.2
S03E13,monica,Gotta keep squishing.,8.2
S03E13,monica,Okay.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it  and it should umm, be.....",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.",8.2
S03E13,joey,These little women. Wow!,8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Your liking it, huh?",8.2
S03E13,joey,Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.",8.2
S03E13,joey,But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.,8.2
S03E13,chandler,"No, actually Laurie’s a boy.",8.2
S03E13,joey,No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,Hey!,8.2
S03E13,chandler,Hey.,8.2
S03E13,ross,"Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,You mean a three pointer?,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,What?  Why are you laughing?!,8.2
S03E13,ross,Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,You guys!! Come on!,8.2
S03E13,chandler,"I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,What do you mean?,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,Hey.,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",8.2
S03E13,monica,"So, how’d the lasagne go over?  It’s a word!",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Yeah, I do think it’s better this way.",8.2
S03E13,monica,I’ll call you back.,8.2
S03E13,monica,So we can be friends who sleep together.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?",8.2
S03E13,monica,Oh.,8.2
S03E13,monica,No!  No!,8.2
S03E13,monica,"‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"That’s all right, that’s well, I figured....",8.2
S03E13,joey,Hey!  How’s it going?,8.2
S03E13,ross,Good.,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?",8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Oh, Danny just went into room 217.",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...",8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!",8.2
S03E13,joey,All right I’ll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?,8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Hmmm, that’s very cool.",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!,8.2
S03E13,chandler,I can’t believe she cracked your code!,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",8.2
S03E13,joey,"Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Eh. Beth dies.,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Beth, Beth dies?",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Um-hmm.,8.2
S03E13,joey,Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?,8.2
S03E13,chandler,"No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",8.2
S03E13,rachel,What?!,8.2
S03E13,ross,Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?,8.2
S03E13,rachel,No. She doesn’t die.,8.2
S03E13,joey,Then why would you say that?!,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"Because, I wanted to hurt you.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Oh my....,8.2
S03E13,monica,Hi.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Sorry. I’m sorry.,8.2
S03E13,monica,"You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs,  in a grill fire.",8.2
S03E13,monica,What are you smiling at?,8.2
S03E13,rachel,"I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Yeah, right.",8.2
S03E13,monica,I love this friend thing!,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?",8.2
S03E13,ross,Oh.,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",8.2
S03E13,ross,"He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,Hey.,8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"No, I can spot you from here.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Okay, listen Robert...",8.2
S03E13,ross,"Hey, don’t we have to...",8.2
S03E13,chandler,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"Umm, I think you’re really, really great...",8.2
S03E13,phoebe,"I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.",8.2
S03E13,monica,Ow!,8.2
S03E13,monica,Oh my God! Oh my God!,8.2
S03E13,monica,"So um, who was she?",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.",8.2
S03E13,monica,"Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.",8.2
S03E13,monica,How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?,8.2
S03E13,monica,Watch the thorns!,8.2
S03E13,rachel,What?,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Beth is really, really sick.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Awwww.,8.2
S03E13,joey,"Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.",8.2
S03E13,rachel,Joey?,8.2
S03E13,joey,Yeah.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Do you want to put the book in the freezer?,8.2
S03E13,joey,Okay.,8.2
S03E13,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S03E14,joey,Wow! This girl is good.,7.9
S03E14,phoebe,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",7.9
S03E14,chandler,I like her.,7.9
S03E14,phoebe,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?,7.9
S03E14,chandler,"Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",7.9
S03E14,monica,Look at you. All jealous.,7.9
S03E14,ross,"Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..",7.9
S03E14,phoebe,"Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.",7.9
S03E14,phoebe,"Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",7.9
S03E14,phoebe,"Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?",7.9

S03E14,rachel,"It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",7.9
S03E14,ross,That’s a little clearer.,7.9

S03E14,phoebe,"No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",7.9
S03E14,phoebe,"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",7.9

S03E15,ross,For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?,8.5
S03E15,rachel,You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!,8.5
S03E15,ross,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.",8.5
S03E15,rachel,"But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",8.5
S03E15,ross,"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",8.5
S03E15,rachel,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",8.5
S03E15,ross,"No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!",8.5
S03E15,rachel,Just a job!,8.5
S03E15,ross,Yes.,8.5
S03E15,rachel,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...,8.5
S03E15,ross,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",8.5
S03E15,rachel,Well neither do I!,8.5
S03E15,ross,Is this about Mark?,8.5

S03E15,chandler,"So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",8.5
S03E15,ross,"Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.",8.5
S03E15,monica,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?",8.5
S03E15,monica,Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.,8.5
S03E15,phoebe,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",8.5
S03E15,phoebe,You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.,8.5
S03E15,phoebe,Interesting.,8.5
S03E15,phoebe,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",8.5
S03E15,monica,I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.,8.5
S03E15,phoebe,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?",8.5
S03E15,monica,"Well, I was having a conversation.",8.5
S03E15,phoebe,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",8.5
S03E15,monica,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?,8.5
S03E15,phoebe,That would be great. Thank you.,8.5

S03E15,rachel,"Oh. Okay, bye.",8.5
S03E15,joey,So what are you gonna do?,8.5
S03E15,ross,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",8.5
S03E15,chandler,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",8.5
S03E15,ross,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?",8.5
S03E15,chandler,"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",8.5
S03E15,chandler,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,8.5
S03E15,joey,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",8.5
S03E15,chandler,Why? What happened to him?,8.5
S03E15,joey,"Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",8.5
S03E15,rachel,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",8.5
S03E15,rachel,"No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",8.5
S03E15,rachel,"Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",8.5

S03E15,monica,Oh.  Can I have a tissue?,8.5
S03E15,phoebe,"Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.",8.5

S03E16,monica,"That’s okay, this is more important than fruit  on my ceiling! You broke up?!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",9.1
S03E16,monica,Oh no!!,9.1
S03E16,rachel,No.,9.1
S03E16,monica,"Rachel, you and Mark?!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.",9.1

S03E16,ross,"Yes, you can, very much.",9.1
S03E16,ross,NA,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Hey!,9.1
S03E16,monica,Hey.,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",9.1
S03E16,monica,"Oh, there’s banana on it.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",9.1
S03E16,monica,So then you know?,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",9.1
S03E16,monica,"Oh, good. Thanks.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Now what is Fabutec?,9.1
S03E16,monica,"Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Waxine!!,9.1
S03E16,monica,Yes! Have you seen it?,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",9.1
S03E16,monica,I know!!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?,9.1
S03E16,monica,Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,They have the best stuff in there.,9.1
S03E16,chandler,Oh my God! Oh my God!,9.1
S03E16,joey,"Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yeah, but don’t you think....",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yeah, okay.",9.1
S03E16,joey,"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?",9.1
S03E16,ross,What trail?,9.1
S03E16,joey,You always have to think about the trail!,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",9.1
S03E16,monica,Did that!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,9.1
S03E16,monica,Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Was it not pain-free?,9.1
S03E16,monica,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",9.1
S03E16,monica,"That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,9.1
S03E16,monica,"Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",9.1
S03E16,ross,Chloe? Hi..,9.1
S03E16,ross,You took my watch?,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Actually, no, we’re not.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"No, we’re not.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"No, we’re not!!",9.1
S03E16,ross,Right.,9.1
S03E16,ross,Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.,9.1
S03E16,ross,Jasmine?,9.1
S03E16,ross,"We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yes, I did.",9.1
S03E16,ross,Very bad.,9.1
S03E16,ross,"I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Thank you, thank you.",9.1
S03E16,ross,Who’s your roommate?,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",9.1
S03E16,monica,Ow!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Oh!!,9.1
S03E16,monica,Ow!! Ow!!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Ow!!!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,We’re all right.,9.1
S03E16,monica,"It’s okay, it’s okay.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,We’re all right.,9.1
S03E16,monica,We were just waxing our legs.,9.1
S03E16,chandler,Off?!!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Oh yeah, come here.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Oh, that’s mature.",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Uh-huh.,9.1
S03E16,monica,That’s right.,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!,9.1
S03E16,monica,What?,9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Nothing, nothing.",9.1
S03E16,monica,Rachel said everything was okay.,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"What, what are they talking about?",9.1
S03E16,ross,Rachel?,9.1
S03E16,rachel,Just get away from me!,9.1
S03E16,ross,"No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",9.1
S03E16,rachel,A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Whe-where did he put it?!,9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Ross, you had sex with another woman!",9.1
S03E16,monica,Oh my God.,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",9.1
S03E16,monica,Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!,9.1
S03E16,chandler,"He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!",9.1
S03E16,ross,No!!,9.1
S03E16,rachel,Just get out! Now!!,9.1
S03E16,ross,No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.,9.1
S03E16,rachel,Okay! All right! How was she?,9.1
S03E16,chandler,Uh-oh.,9.1
S03E16,ross,What?,9.1
S03E16,rachel,Was she good?,9.1
S03E16,joey,Don’t answer that.,9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",9.1
S03E16,ross,She was...,9.1
S03E16,joey,Awful! Horrible!,9.1
S03E16,chandler,She was not good. Not good.,9.1
S03E16,joey,She was nothing compared to you.,9.1
S03E16,ross,"She, she was different.",9.1
S03E16,joey,Ewwwww!,9.1
S03E16,chandler,Uh-oh.,9.1
S03E16,rachel,Good different?,9.1
S03E16,ross,Nobody likes change.,9.1
S03E16,ross,"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,Should we do something?,9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,We were on a break!,9.1
S03E16,ross,"That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore.",9.1
S03E16,monica,"What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",9.1
S03E16,joey,Why not?!  I’m hungry.,9.1
S03E16,monica,Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.,9.1
S03E16,rachel,God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Yeah, we’ll be fine.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,"Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.",9.1
S03E16,ross,Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?,9.1
S03E16,rachel,All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?,9.1
S03E16,ross,Yes I would.,9.1
S03E16,rachel,"You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",9.1

S03E16,ross,"You can have the last piece, if you want.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.",9.1

S03E16,chandler,What?,9.1
S03E16,joey,"Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.",9.1
S03E16,chandler,Are you actually saying these words?,9.1
S03E16,ross,"What, now you’re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",9.1
S03E16,joey,"Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.",9.1
S03E16,monica,Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,"Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",9.1
S03E16,rachel,That’s....,9.1
S03E16,ross,That’s what?!,9.1
S03E16,rachel,That is neither here nor there.,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Okay, okay, okay.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,I think you should go.,9.1
S03E16,ross,What?,9.1
S03E16,rachel,I really think you need to go now.,9.1
S03E16,ross,"Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"Yeah, what the hell did I know!",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  and, and....",9.1
S03E16,rachel,"it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",9.1
S03E16,ross,"Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",9.1
S03E16,rachel,Then how come it is?,9.1
S03E16,phoebe,They’ve been quiet for a long time.,9.1
S03E16,joey,Maybe she killed him?,9.1
S03E16,chandler,Let’s go.,9.1
S03E16,chandler,Is that your new walk?,9.1
S03E16,joey,"No, I really have to pee.",9.1
S03E17,joey,Can I see the comics?,8.3
S03E17,chandler,This is the New York Times.,8.3
S03E17,joey,"Okay, may I see the comics?",8.3
S03E17,monica,Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?,8.3
S03E17,chandler,We are. He’s meeting us here.,8.3

S03E17,joey,"Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....",8.3
S03E17,chandler,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",8.3
S03E17,joey,Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.,8.3
S03E17,phoebe,Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.,8.3
S03E17,joey,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",8.3
S03E17,phoebe,"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",8.3
S03E17,chandler,"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",8.3
S03E17,phoebe,"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",8.3
S03E17,joey,I had the same dream!,8.3
S03E17,phoebe,"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",8.3
S03E17,joey,"Oh, I had the opposite dream.",8.3
S03E17,chandler,"Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",8.3
S03E17,joey,"Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",8.3
S03E17,monica,It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.,8.3
S03E17,monica,"Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!",8.3
S03E17,rachel,Hey!,8.3

S03E18,ross,"Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.",8.4
S03E18,rachel,"Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",8.4

S03E18,rachel,"Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",8.4
S03E18,monica,"Pete, can I get you something else?",8.4
S03E18,monica,Haven’t you and I covered that topic?,8.4
S03E18,monica,"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",8.4
S03E18,rachel,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",8.4
S03E18,monica,"I mean really, think about it.",8.4
S03E18,phoebe,"No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life,  y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",8.4
S03E18,ross,"Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?",8.4

S03E18,joey,"Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.",8.4
S03E18,phoebe,"But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank,  and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",8.4
S03E18,joey,"Well, have-have you told him how you feel?",8.4
S03E18,phoebe,Yes. Not out loud.,8.4
S03E18,ross,"Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.",8.4
S03E18,phoebe,"Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.",8.4
S03E18,phoebe,"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",8.4
S03E18,phoebe,"Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank.",8.4
S03E18,joey,"So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.",8.4

S03E19,monica,"Absolutely!  Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",8.2
S03E19,phoebe,"Yeah, kinda.",8.2
S03E19,joey,"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’.  Nothing.",8.2
S03E19,joey,Yeah.,8.2
S03E19,joey,"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.",8.2
S03E19,joey,It does in mine!,8.2
S03E19,chandler,"I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",8.2
S03E19,ross,You bug me.,8.2
S03E19,chandler,Is there any chance you didn’t see that?,8.2
S03E19,chandler,Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!,8.2
S03E19,ross,"I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,You didn’t just break up.,8.2
S03E19,ross,"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!,8.2
S03E19,ross,"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.",8.2
S03E19,chandler,Okay.,8.2
S03E19,ross,"She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.,8.2
S03E19,ross,"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,Stop what?!,8.2
S03E19,ross,"I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,No!! You can’t!!,8.2
S03E19,ross,"Look, they must be stopped!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!",8.2
S03E19,ross,I need juice! People need juice!!,8.2
S03E19,chandler,Look man!,8.2
S03E19,ross,People need juice!,8.2
S03E19,chandler,Listen to me!!,8.2
S03E19,ross,"Juice, I need...",8.2
S03E19,chandler,"She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.",8.2
S03E19,ross,"Yeah, okay.",8.2
S03E19,chandler,Okay.,8.2
S03E19,ross,It’s just I miss her so much.,8.2
S03E19,chandler,I know.,8.2
S03E19,rachel,"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",8.2
S03E19,rachel,Y'know what?,8.2
S03E19,rachel,I can’t do this.,8.2
S03E19,rachel,"Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",8.2
S03E19,rachel,Oh God. I’m sorry about this.,8.2
S03E19,rachel,You sure?,8.2
S03E19,monica,Sure.,8.2
S03E19,monica,"Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.",8.2
S03E19,monica,"Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",8.2
S03E19,monica,"So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?",8.2
S03E19,monica,I so wanna be attracted to you.,8.2
S03E19,monica,I’m sorry.,8.2
S03E19,monica,It’s not?,8.2
S03E19,monica,"Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",8.2
S03E19,chandler,I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.,8.2
S03E19,chandler,"Uh-oh, what did she do now?",8.2
S03E19,joey,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!",8.2
S03E19,chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.",8.2
S03E19,joey,"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’",8.2
S03E19,chandler,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.,8.2
S03E19,joey,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?",8.2
S03E19,chandler,"I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.",8.2
S03E19,joey,"Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.",8.2
S03E19,chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",8.2
S03E19,joey,"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!",8.2
S03E19,joey,"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’.  Nothing.",8.2
S03E19,joey,Better?,8.2
S03E19,joey,"Ah, Kate?",8.2
S03E19,joey,"You ah, you forgot your shoes.",8.2
S03E19,joey,"Hey, listen you ah....",8.2
S03E19,joey,...feel like getting a cup of coffee?,8.2
S03E19,joey,"Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.",8.2
S03E19,phoebe,"Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...",8.2
S03E19,chandler,‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.,8.2
S03E19,phoebe,It isn’t?,8.2
S03E19,chandler,"No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",8.2
S03E19,phoebe,"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!",8.2
S03E19,rachel,Hey!,8.2
S03E19,monica,"Hey, Rach, how was work?",8.2
S03E19,rachel,"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",8.2
S03E19,monica,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",8.2
S03E19,rachel,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and...",8.2
S03E19,monica,Something wrong?,8.2
S03E19,rachel,NA,8.2
S03E19,chandler,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",8.2
S03E19,phoebe,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",8.2
S03E19,chandler,What about things that are already gold?,8.2
S03E19,phoebe,"Ahh, his work is done.",8.2
S03E19,chandler,"Okay, let’s play my game now.",8.2
S03E19,phoebe,Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!,8.2
S03E20,chandler,"Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",8.1
S03E20,joey,Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it’s like to be you?,8.1
S03E20,monica,"Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",8.1
S03E20,joey,"Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",8.1
S03E20,ross,Hey!,8.1
S03E20,ross,"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",8.1
S03E20,monica,"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",8.1
S03E20,ross,We were all pretty shaken up about it.,8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",8.1
S03E20,ross,"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",8.1
S03E20,monica,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!  And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",8.1
S03E20,ross,You get the dollhouse.,8.1
S03E20,monica,I get the dollhouse!,8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",8.1
S03E20,joey,"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?",8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"No, just a barrel.",8.1
S03E20,monica,"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",8.1
S03E20,phoebe,Really?! Really?!,8.1
S03E20,monica,"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",8.1
S03E20,chandler,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.,8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Hey, Sophie!",8.1
S03E20,chandler,Hey.,8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem.",8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?",8.1

S03E20,rachel,"No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!",8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?",8.1
S03E20,monica,"Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!",8.1

S03E20,phoebe,"That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.",8.1
S03E20,monica,Not one that can pee on the roof.,8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",8.1
S03E20,chandler,And is this in case the house sneezes?,8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",8.1
S03E20,monica,I don’t want a ghost.,8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",8.1
S03E20,ross,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",8.1
S03E20,rachel,Hey!,8.1

S03E20,phoebe,Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!,8.1
S03E20,monica,"Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",8.1
S03E20,phoebe,"Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.",8.1
S03E20,ross,"Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!",8.1

S03E20,monica,"It’s very interesting, Phoebe.",8.1
S03E20,rachel,What’s this?,8.1

S03E20,rachel,Hmm.,8.1
S03E20,chandler,"Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",8.1
S03E20,rachel,What?!,8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Oh, I....",8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Oh, I know...",8.1
S03E20,joey,"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",8.1
S03E20,joey,That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?,8.1
S03E20,joey,"Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?",8.1
S03E20,joey,Do you want me to want you to care?,8.1

S03E20,joey,"Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",8.1
S03E20,joey,"And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",8.1
S03E20,joey,Something like that?,8.1
S03E20,joey,Yeah.,8.1
S03E20,joey,Hey.,8.1

S03E20,monica,Oh my.,8.1

S03E20,chandler,"I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’",8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",8.1
S03E20,chandler,That’s what you say at the end of a date.,8.1
S03E20,rachel,"You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",8.1
S03E20,monica,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Well, they always called.",8.1
S03E20,monica,"Hmm, bite me.",8.1

S03E20,rachel,"Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"Oh, well give me the phone then.",8.1
S03E20,rachel,"Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",8.1
S03E20,rachel,Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.,8.1
S03E20,chandler,Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,8.1
S03E20,rachel,"I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",8.1
S03E20,rachel,That’s fine!,8.1
S03E20,chandler,"That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.",8.1
S03E20,rachel,I know.,8.1

S03E20,joey,"Y'know, about what happened with us.",8.1
S03E20,joey,"What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.",8.1
S03E20,joey,Nooo.,8.1

S03E20,phoebe,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,  and it’s all the time.",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"Yes, this, this was pleasant.",8.1
S03E20,chandler,"The food there was, was great.",8.1
S03E20,chandler,So take care.,8.1
S03E20,chandler,"Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.",8.1
S03E20,rachel,Sophie’s desk.,8.1
S03E20,rachel,Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!,8.1
S03E20,chandler,Noo!,8.1
S03E20,rachel,Chandler!!,8.1

S03E20,rachel,"Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.",8.1

S03E23,monica,"Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.",8.1
S03E23,chandler,"Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.",8.1
S03E23,monica,"Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.",8.1
S03E23,ross,Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.,8.1

S03E23,chandler,"Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?",8.1
S03E23,phoebe,"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!",8.1
S03E23,rachel,"OH MY GOD!!!  Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.",8.1
S03E23,phoebe,"Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?",8.1

S03E23,phoebe,Like for clubbing.,8.1
S03E23,monica,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.  I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",8.1
S03E23,rachel,Oh my God.,8.1
S03E23,monica,I know.,8.1
S03E23,phoebe,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",8.1
S03E23,rachel,You didn’t break up with that fireman?,8.1
S03E23,phoebe,"No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.",8.1
S03E23,rachel,Wow!,8.1
S03E23,phoebe,"Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",8.1
S03E23,monica,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?",8.1
S03E23,phoebe,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  So… It’s really just about the math.",8.1

S03E24,phoebe,"No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.",8.1
S03E24,monica,He didn’t ask me to marry him.,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,Well then definately don’t take his name.,8.1
S03E24,monica,He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.,8.1
S03E24,rachel,Why?! What is it?,8.1

S03E24,monica,What’s fish hooking?,8.1
S03E24,ross,"Huh, what’s fish hooking...  Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",8.1

S03E24,phoebe,"Yeesh, what’d you do about it?",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",8.1
S03E24,monica,"I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.",8.1
S03E24,joey,"Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.",8.1

S03E24,joey,"Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",8.1
S03E24,chandler,What if Joey were president?,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",8.1
S03E24,rachel,Yeah.,8.1

S03E24,rachel,"Oh, ah with who?",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",8.1
S03E24,rachel,Oh!  That’s fine.,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Great! Okay, good for you!",8.1
S03E24,monica,Hi!,8.1
S03E24,monica,"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.",8.1
S03E24,monica,Promise me you’ll be careful.,8.1
S03E24,monica,"Hey, are we still on for tonight?",8.1
S03E24,monica,"Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",8.1
S03E24,monica,How ‘bout just a boom?,8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",8.1

S03E24,phoebe,"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,How could you not tell me that she has hair?,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Why, does she have a bad personality?",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!",8.1
S03E24,chandler,What is with him?,8.1

S03E24,monica,Hey!  It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.,8.1
S03E24,monica,"I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",8.1
S03E24,monica,"Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",8.1
S03E24,monica,"Well, no. But...",8.1
S03E24,monica,That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!,8.1
S03E24,monica,You didn’t know that already?,8.1
S03E24,monica,"Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.",8.1
S03E24,monica,Yeah. That-that was the problem.,8.1
S03E24,monica,Hey.,8.1
S03E24,ross,Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?,8.1
S03E24,monica,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",8.1
S03E24,ross,Hot dog?,8.1
S03E24,monica,"Four, please.",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",8.1
S03E24,ross,"What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Ohh, that’s too bad!",8.1
S03E24,ross,"No, I-I’m saying I liked her.",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",8.1
S03E24,ross,"Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",8.1

S03E24,joey,"Hey, the fight’s starting!",8.1
S03E24,ross,"Okay, we’ll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",8.1
S03E24,joey,Fight’s over!,8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"No, I ah, I didn’t do them.",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",8.1
S03E24,chandler,Doug!!,8.1
S03E24,chandler,I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,8.1
S03E24,chandler,"No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",8.1
S03E24,chandler,Okay.,8.1
S03E24,chandler,Ahhhhh!,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,No! No! Look at that!  It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!,8.1
S03E24,rachel,Phoebe!,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,You said it was okay!,8.1
S03E24,rachel,You said she was bald!!,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!,8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",8.1
S03E24,rachel,Yes.,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?,8.1
S03E24,rachel,Yes.,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,So?,8.1
S03E24,rachel,"I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!",8.1
S03E24,phoebe,Oh no.,8.1
S03E24,rachel,What?,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Oh, we killed them all.",8.1
S03E24,rachel,Oh!,8.1
S03E24,monica,Please tell me you’re stopping now.,8.1
S03E24,monica,You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!,8.1
S03E24,monica,"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",8.1
S03E24,monica,"Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.",8.1
S03E24,monica,Then I’ve gotta go. Bye.,8.1
S03E24,monica,Yes?,8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Thank you, sir.",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",8.1
S03E24,chandler,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!",8.1
S03E24,rachel,"Oh, I can’t watch this.",8.1
S03E24,joey,"Check it out, he’s winning!  Pete’s winning!",8.1
S03E24,monica,Really?!,8.1
S03E24,joey,No-o-o!!,8.1
S03E24,phoebe,"Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",8.1
S03E24,ross,"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.",8.1
S03E25,chandler,"So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!",8.9
S03E25,chandler,Tell it again.  Seriously.,8.9
S03E25,rachel,I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?,8.9
S03E25,joey,"Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.",8.9
S03E25,monica,"Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.",8.9
S03E25,joey,"Well, I think we all learned something.",8.9
S03E25,phoebe,That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.,8.9
S03E25,chandler,"Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.",8.9
S03E25,phoebe,Y'know what that means?,8.9
S03E25,joey,That you’re actually 50?,8.9
S03E25,phoebe,"No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.",8.9
S03E25,rachel,That is so cool.,8.9
S03E25,phoebe,"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",8.9
S03E25,ross,That’s too bad.,8.9
S03E25,rachel,"Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.",8.9
S03E25,phoebe,So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.,8.9
S03E25,joey,"Hey, Bonnie had sex there!",8.9
S03E25,monica,Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.,8.9
S03E25,chandler,"You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.",8.9
S03E25,monica,Thanks!,8.9
S03E25,chandler,"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.",8.9
S03E25,monica,Yeah right.,8.9
S03E25,chandler,Why is that so funny?,8.9
S03E25,monica,You made a joke right? So I laughed.,8.9
S03E25,chandler,"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?",8.9
S03E25,monica,"Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!",8.9
S03E25,chandler,"Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like  “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”",8.9
S03E25,monica,Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.,8.9
S03E25,joey,Hey!,8.9
S03E25,monica,"Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",8.9
S03E25,joey,"No, it’s just my luggage.",8.9
S03E25,joey,Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!,8.9
S03E25,phoebe,"Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.",8.9
S03E25,ross,"Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?",8.9
S03E25,phoebe,"Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.",8.9
S03E25,rachel,Hey!,8.9
S03E25,chandler,Hey!,8.9
S03E25,joey,"Hey-hey, check out the hat!",8.9

S04E02,ross,"So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?",8.1

S04E03,joey,Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!",8.5
S04E03,joey,Huh?!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!,8.5
S04E03,joey,"Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,Could we be more white trash?,8.5
S04E03,monica,How desperate am I?,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.",8.5
S04E03,monica,I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,How come?,8.5
S04E03,monica,"Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",8.5
S04E03,ross,"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",8.5
S04E03,monica,You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",8.5
S04E03,joey,Just pickle.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?",8.5
S04E03,chandler,No. No!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Well, not at first.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,What is she doing here?,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,Thank you.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",8.5
S04E03,joey,"Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"Doing great, the quiches are coming along.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"Yeah, I thought it was cute.",8.5
S04E03,monica,Let me ask you a question.,8.5
S04E03,monica,Why did you hire me?,8.5
S04E03,monica,Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Okay, I didn’t hear that.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian!",8.5
S04E03,joey,Uhhhh.,8.5
S04E03,joey,"No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.",8.5
S04E03,ross,…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.,8.5
S04E03,monica,…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,…it was like the Algonquin kids table.,8.5
S04E03,joey,Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,That’s weird.,8.5
S04E03,monica,What?,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,Your nails.,8.5
S04E03,monica,"Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.",8.5
S04E03,monica,Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!,8.5
S04E03,monica,Then why are you laughing?,8.5
S04E03,monica,What? You bet I’d lose a nail?,8.5
S04E03,monica,Frozen lasagnas?,8.5
S04E03,monica,You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…,8.5
S04E03,monica,"You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,I don’t get it.,8.5
S04E03,monica,NA,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Op, the ruined quiches are ready.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Okay.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Thanks.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Okay.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,I’m getting dressed.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,What is it?,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me.  Ooh, saucy.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Okay. But if you don’t come back soon,  there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"That’s weird, she locked the door.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?",8.5
S04E03,chandler,Hi!  How are you?,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Hello, Joanna……’s office.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,How little?!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,Why not?!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,What?!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,What?!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,You promised you would break up with her!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",8.5
S04E03,rachel,And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,Never!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,You never come into this office again!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Fine!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,You give me back my Walkman!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,I—never borrowed your Walkman.,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,Does it hurt?,8.5
S04E03,chandler,"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!",8.5
S04E03,rachel,Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?,8.5
S04E03,chandler,About what?,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",8.5
S04E03,rachel,"No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Well, this is much better.",8.5
S04E03,joey,He cut off his ear.,8.5
S04E03,joey,I’m out.,8.5
S04E03,joey,Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?,8.5
S04E03,joey,"In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.",8.5
S04E03,joey,Spock’s birth control.,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,Hey!,8.5
S04E03,monica,Hi.,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.,8.5
S04E03,monica,"Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",8.5
S04E03,monica,What?,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, \Yeah",8.5
S04E03,monica,"All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",8.5
S04E03,phoebe,Wow! My breasts are really strong.,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,"Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?,8.5
S04E03,chandler,It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.,8.5
S04E03,rachel,Foot rubs for a month!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Freedom!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,Sophie sit!!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"No! God, would you just calm down!",8.5
S04E03,chandler,I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just…,8.5
S04E03,joey,Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit.,8.5
S04E03,joey,"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",8.5
S04E03,joey,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",8.5
S04E03,joey,"You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!",8.5
S04E03,joey,"And a 50.  Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.",8.5

S04E03,rachel,Yeah!!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,No!,8.5
S04E03,rachel,D’oh!!  I’ve got it!,8.5
S04E03,chandler,You don’t have it.,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,How do Monica and Phoebe know?,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  stingy.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,Go on.,8.5
S04E03,rachel,I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.,8.5
S04E03,chandler,And Milton Berle has a…,8.5
S04E03,rachel,"Ohh, not compared to you.",8.5
S04E03,monica,Well?,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,They’re not even touching the lasagna!,8.5
S04E03,monica,Really?!,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Oh, they love your casserole.",8.5
S04E03,monica,Yes!!,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.,8.5
S04E03,monica,And you?,8.5
S04E03,monica,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…",8.5
S04E03,monica,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",8.5
S04E03,monica,Wow!,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica.",8.5
S04E03,monica,"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",8.5
S04E03,chandler,Hello.,8.5
S04E03,monica,NA,8.5

S04E03,chandler,"Two hours, that lasted!",8.5
S04E03,rachel,So did you break up with Joanna?,8.5
S04E03,chandler,I think so.,8.5
S04E03,joey,"Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",8.5
S04E03,ross,The volcano?,8.5
S04E03,joey,"Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.",8.5
S04E03,rachel,What?!,8.5
S04E03,joey,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",8.5
S04E03,monica,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?,8.5
S04E03,joey,"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",8.5
S04E03,monica,Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?,8.5
S04E03,phoebe,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",8.5

S04E03,rachel,Okay.,8.5
S04E04,phoebe,"Hey! New wallet, huh?",8.2
S04E04,chandler,"Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",8.2
S04E04,monica,Rachel!,8.2
S04E04,rachel,What?,8.2
S04E04,monica,You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!,8.2
S04E04,rachel,"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",8.2
S04E04,monica,Have you ever taken out the trash?,8.2
S04E04,rachel,"Well, I thought you liked doing it.",8.2
S04E04,monica,Third door on the left.,8.2
S04E04,rachel,Right!,8.2
S04E04,rachel,"Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",8.2
S04E04,rachel,Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but…,8.2
S04E04,rachel,I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,8.2
S04E04,rachel,No.,8.2
S04E04,rachel,I didn’t… I never said that.,8.2

S04E04,monica,God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.],8.2
S04E04,joey,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",8.2
S04E04,rachel,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.,8.2
S04E04,joey,I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,8.2
S04E04,monica,"Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",8.2
S04E04,rachel,"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"All right that’s it, school is in session!",8.2
S04E04,monica,My God! Is this a gym card?,8.2
S04E04,chandler,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",8.2
S04E04,ross,So why don’t you quit?,8.2
S04E04,chandler,"You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",8.2
S04E04,ross,Who is Maria?,8.2
S04E04,chandler,"Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",8.2
S04E04,ross,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,8.2
S04E04,chandler,No!,8.2
S04E04,ross,So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?,8.2
S04E04,chandler,"Oh no, you’ll have to come.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",8.2
S04E04,joey,I have actually not heard of that.,8.2
S04E04,joey,Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know!,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",8.2
S04E04,monica,What’s the matter?,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",8.2
S04E04,monica,So do them for free.,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",8.2
S04E04,ross,They make you take an oath?,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",8.2
S04E04,chandler,Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.",8.2
S04E04,rachel,"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",8.2
S04E04,monica,Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.,8.2
S04E04,chandler,Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!,8.2
S04E04,monica,You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,I don’t what your talking about.,8.2
S04E04,ross,Then how do you explain the toe ring?!,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!,8.2
S04E04,rachel,Oh! My hero! What happened?,8.2
S04E04,joey,"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.",8.2
S04E04,monica,"What a minute, what did he say?",8.2
S04E04,joey,"He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.",8.2
S04E04,rachel,What?! You got us evicted!!,8.2
S04E04,monica,I told you not to go down there!,8.2
S04E04,joey,Well he made Rachel cry!,8.2
S04E04,monica,Rachel always cries!,8.2
S04E04,rachel,That’s not true!,8.2
S04E04,monica,"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!",8.2
S04E04,joey,"All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",8.2
S04E04,rachel,Go!!,8.2
S04E04,joey,"All right, all right, all right.",8.2
S04E04,ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.",8.2
S04E04,chandler,Yes.  Yes!,8.2
S04E04,ross,"One more time, \Hey",8.2
S04E04,chandler,No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!,8.2
S04E04,ross,Good! That’s good!,8.2
S04E04,chandler,Okay.  I wanna quit the gym.,8.2
S04E04,chandler,I wanna quit the gym.,8.2
S04E04,chandler,I wanna quit the gym.,8.2
S04E04,ross,Me? No.,8.2
S04E04,chandler,I wanna quit the gym.,8.2
S04E04,ross,"It’s okay man, be strong.",8.2
S04E04,ross,"No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.",8.2
S04E04,phoebe,These old things.,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.",8.2
S04E04,phoebe,"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real  nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",8.2
S04E04,phoebe,Oh.,8.2
S04E04,phoebe,No!,8.2
S04E04,joey,"Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",8.2
S04E04,joey,"Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"Yeah-yeah, absolutely.",8.2
S04E04,joey,"What, what is it?",8.2
S04E04,joey,"That’s not, prison lingo, is it?",8.2
S04E04,monica,His dancing partner?!,8.2
S04E04,joey,"Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.",8.2

S04E05,rachel,What was that?,8.4
S04E05,ross,Monica knows.,8.4
S04E05,monica,"It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",8.4

S04E05,chandler,You-you do?,8.4
S04E05,joey,Yeah! You don't like Kathy.,8.4
S04E05,chandler,You got me.,8.4
S04E05,joey,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",8.4
S04E05,chandler,Yeah. Right.,8.4
S04E05,joey,"Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",8.4

S04E05,rachel,Yeah!  Ohhh!,8.4
S04E05,monica,What?,8.4
S04E05,rachel,I think he's stealing from me.,8.4
S04E05,monica,Why?,8.4
S04E05,rachel,Because he's stealing from me!,8.4
S04E05,phoebe,"Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",8.4
S04E05,rachel,Ughh!,8.4
S04E05,phoebe,"Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",8.4
S04E05,monica,Thank you so much Phoebe.,8.4
S04E05,phoebe,Sure.,8.4
S04E05,monica,What are you doing with those?!,8.4

S04E05,joey,Is she great or what?,8.4
S04E05,chandler,"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",8.4
S04E05,chandler,Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.,8.4
S04E05,chandler,"Uhh, no-no thanks.",8.4
S04E05,chandler,"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.",8.4
S04E05,joey,What was that?,8.4
S04E05,chandler,What?,8.4
S04E05,joey,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,8.4
S04E05,chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?",8.4
S04E05,joey,"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",8.4
S04E05,chandler,I am pretending.,8.4
S04E05,joey,"Well then, do it better!",8.4
S04E05,chandler,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",8.4
S04E05,joey,"Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",8.4
S04E05,ross,"So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",8.4
S04E05,monica,"No, sorry.",8.4
S04E05,rachel,Well where's Amanda?,8.4
S04E05,monica,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",8.4
S04E05,rachel,"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",8.4
S04E05,monica,"Ross, cough drops, please?",8.4
S04E05,ross,At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.,8.4
S04E05,rachel,"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",8.4
S04E05,ross,You see Amanda and I have a very special...,8.4
S04E05,monica,You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!,8.4
S04E05,rachel,"Ohh, that is soo sad.",8.4
S04E05,monica,"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",8.4
S04E05,rachel,"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!",8.4
S04E05,monica,"That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",8.4
S04E05,ross,Fine.,8.4
S04E05,rachel,Sorry.,8.4
S04E05,ross,Here.  At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.,8.4
S04E05,rachel,Y'know...,8.4
S04E05,phoebe,Does it even work without my sexy voice?,8.4
S04E05,phoebe,"Gunther, kiss me.",8.4
S04E05,joey,"Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",8.4
S04E05,chandler,Can I sleep on your couch?,8.4
S04E05,phoebe,And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.,8.4
S04E05,rachel,Yeah.,8.4

S04E06,phoebe,"Yeah, come to papa.",8.5
S04E06,ross,I know!,8.5
S04E06,monica,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",8.5
S04E06,ross,"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",8.5
S04E06,ross,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.,8.5
S04E06,ross,Fine by me; hope she wins.,8.5
S04E06,chandler,Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?,8.5

S04E06,chandler,"Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Well, I have a call in about that.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,'Kay.,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, \I secretly love you",8.5
S04E06,chandler,It doesn't say that. Does it?,8.5
S04E06,ross,How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!,8.5
S04E06,monica,I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.,8.5
S04E06,rachel,Oh my God! What happened?,8.5
S04E06,monica,Sixty guests.,8.5
S04E06,ross,"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",8.5
S04E06,monica,Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican...  ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",8.5
S04E06,monica,I don't know.,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",8.5
S04E06,monica,Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Well, you're not working either.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Yes, but I'm doing this.",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",8.5
S04E06,joey,Hey!,8.5
S04E06,joey,Why?,8.5
S04E06,joey,You can pee here!,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?",8.5
S04E06,joey,"We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.",8.5
S04E06,joey,"Oh, I know...",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"And not one of your coupons for an hour of \Joey Love.\""",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.,8.5
S04E06,monica,Hey!,8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Hey, how'd it go?",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,Mon! I'm so happy for you!,8.5
S04E06,monica,"Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",8.5
S04E06,monica,Okay.,8.5
S04E06,ross,Huh...,8.5
S04E06,ross,Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?,8.5
S04E06,ross,Mitzi is.....,8.5
S04E06,ross,"...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?",8.5
S04E06,ross,"Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...",8.5
S04E06,ross,"Oh, yeah, why not?",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Oh, is everything in the car?",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,Yes. Did you settle the bill?,8.5
S04E06,monica,No. I hate this part.,8.5

S04E06,monica,"No, that's not mine.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",8.5

S04E06,monica,"Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",8.5
S04E06,monica,Just the matter of ...payment?,8.5
S04E06,rachel,You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.,8.5
S04E06,chandler,Sure...,8.5
S04E06,rachel,And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"I don't know... um, Grease?",8.5
S04E06,rachel,No....,8.5
S04E06,chandler,Rent?,8.5
S04E06,rachel,Yes! Rent!,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Okay, so when do you want to go?",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",8.5
S04E06,joey,"Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Yes, it is, at Office Max.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,What did you get her?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,A pen.,8.5
S04E06,joey,It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,8.5
S04E06,joey,Why not?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",8.5
S04E06,joey,"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... \Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!\""",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",8.5
S04E06,joey,She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.,8.5
S04E06,chandler,For three years?,8.5
S04E06,joey,"Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",8.5
S04E06,joey,"Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",8.5
S04E06,chandler,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,8.5
S04E06,joey,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"But Mon, you have to get our money!",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",8.5
S04E06,monica,What?,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, \that massage wasn't long enough",8.5
S04E06,monica,Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,She seems fine now.,8.5
S04E06,joey,"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",8.5
S04E06,ross,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?,8.5
S04E06,joey,Yeah.,8.5
S04E06,ross,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.",8.5
S04E06,joey,"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",8.5
S04E06,ross,What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.,8.5
S04E06,joey,"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",8.5
S04E06,ross,"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",8.5
S04E06,joey,What kind of smell?,8.5
S04E06,ross,I don't know. Soap?,8.5
S04E06,joey,"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",8.5
S04E06,ross,Yeah.,8.5
S04E06,joey,"You wanna see her again, right?",8.5
S04E06,ross,Yeah.,8.5
S04E06,joey,So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!,8.5
S04E06,ross,"Yeah, okay you're right.",8.5
S04E06,joey,Yeah.,8.5
S04E06,ross,"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?",8.5
S04E06,joey,Yeah!,8.5
S04E06,ross,"It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",8.5
S04E06,joey,All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink!,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,Any luck?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \Invisible things for Kathy.\""  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?""",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",8.5
S04E06,chandler,Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,8.5
S04E06,rachel,Oh! Pathetic!,8.5
S04E06,joey,Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!,8.5
S04E06,chandler,Where?,8.5

S04E06,chandler,I got something for her.  It's a book!,8.5
S04E06,joey,Is it like a book that's also a safe?,8.5
S04E06,chandler,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",8.5
S04E06,joey,"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",8.5
S04E06,chandler,"No, it came out to an even twenty.",8.5
S04E06,joey,Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"You didn't get the money, did you?",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey, widow?",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Okay, Widow!",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,"Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,Good.,8.5

S04E06,monica,"Oh, that's great! Congratulations!",8.5
S04E06,rachel,"Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",8.5
S04E06,monica,"Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",8.5
S04E06,phoebe,Yeah. I'm a hard ass.,8.5
S04E06,monica,And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.,8.5
S04E06,phoebe,Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!,8.5

S04E07,ross,"Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth!",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,8.7

S04E07,joey,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,8.7
S04E07,chandler,Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!,8.7
S04E07,joey,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",8.7
S04E07,joey,What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",8.7
S04E07,joey,You got all that from the back of her head?,8.7

S04E07,phoebe,"Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.",8.7
S04E07,monica,"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",8.7

S04E07,ross,"Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?",8.7
S04E07,monica,Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!,8.7
S04E07,rachel,"Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",8.7

S04E07,phoebe,I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.,8.7
S04E07,monica,"Phoebe, Ross sucks!",8.7
S04E07,rachel,"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",8.7
S04E07,monica,"Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",8.7
S04E07,rachel,"Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!",8.7

S04E07,joey,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,I sure did.,8.7
S04E07,joey,Why?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",8.7
S04E07,joey,"Well, you’re amazing.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.,8.7
S04E07,joey,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",8.7
S04E07,joey,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Oh, I don’t know.",8.7
S04E07,joey,"Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,You mean with Casey.,8.7
S04E07,joey,"No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Or Casey.,8.7
S04E07,joey,"No-no, Kathy.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Could be Casey.,8.7
S04E07,joey,"No. No, Kathy.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Consider Casey.,8.7
S04E07,joey,Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!,8.7
S04E07,ross,Hey!,8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.",8.7
S04E07,ross,Pheebs…,8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…",8.7
S04E07,ross,"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Yeah, okay.",8.7
S04E07,ross,Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.,8.7
S04E07,monica,Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!,8.7

S04E07,monica,Are you serious?,8.7
S04E07,phoebe,Does Joey know?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?",8.7
S04E07,monica,You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.,8.7
S04E07,ross,"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"I think maybe, yeah.",8.7
S04E07,monica,He loves you.,8.7
S04E07,chandler,Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!,8.7
S04E07,ross,"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",8.7
S04E07,rachel,"I know, I remember that!",8.7
S04E07,monica,I remember you did.,8.7
S04E07,chandler,God!!  What am I gonna do?!,8.7
S04E07,rachel,"Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!,8.7
S04E07,rachel,Because you do.,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Yeah, I know.",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Hey!,8.7
S04E07,joey,Hey! Samboucha Margarita?,8.7

S04E07,joey,"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",8.7
S04E07,joey,What’s up?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",8.7
S04E07,joey,You do?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,Yeah.,8.7
S04E07,joey,"Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,What?,8.7
S04E07,joey,"Yeah, she broke up with me.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Oh uh, when?",8.7
S04E07,joey,"Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",8.7
S04E07,joey,"Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.",8.7
S04E07,joey,"No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Yeah?,8.7
S04E07,joey,Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",8.7
S04E07,joey,"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…",8.7
S04E07,chandler,"See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",8.7
S04E07,joey,Who?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,It’s me. I’m the other guy.,8.7
S04E07,joey,What?,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",8.7
S04E07,joey,And what?! Did you sleep with her?!,8.7
S04E07,chandler,No! No! No! I just kissed her.,8.7
S04E07,joey,What?!! That’s even worse!!,8.7
S04E07,chandler,How is that worse?!,8.7
S04E07,joey,I don’t know! But it’s the same!,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!",8.7
S04E07,joey,Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!,8.7
S04E07,chandler,"You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",8.7
S04E07,joey,"Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!,8.7
S04E07,joey,"Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",8.7
S04E07,chandler,Probably because…,8.7
S04E07,joey,Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.,8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",8.7
S04E07,monica,What?,8.7
S04E07,rachel,"Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Thank you, thanks.  would you, can you finish my set?",8.7
S04E07,phoebe,"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Yeah, like I could lose it.",8.7
S04E07,rachel,What?,8.7
S04E07,ross,I played bad on purpose guys.,8.7
S04E07,monica,"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",8.7
S04E07,ross,"Yeah—no, just that last song.",8.7
S04E08,joey,Hello.,9.1
S04E08,chandler,NA,9.1

S04E08,phoebe,"Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!",9.1
S04E08,rachel,So are things with you and Joey any better?,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",9.1
S04E08,rachel,"Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",9.1
S04E08,ross,Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?,9.1
S04E08,rachel,You shouldn’t.,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",9.1
S04E08,ross,Who gets whom.  I don’t know why I do that.,9.1
S04E08,rachel,"Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",9.1
S04E08,monica,We haven’t eaten yet!,9.1
S04E08,rachel,"I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.",9.1
S04E08,phoebe,I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!,9.1
S04E08,chandler,Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Her initials…,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,Ohh.,9.1
S04E08,monica,"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.",9.1
S04E08,monica,Who cares? He works in a museum!,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Thanks.,9.1
S04E08,monica,What is wrong with this freezer?!  Ow! Ow!!,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"God, what happened?!",9.1
S04E08,monica,"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",9.1
S04E08,rachel,People are trying to sleep in here!,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.",9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Open it up, let me see.",9.1
S04E08,monica,"Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Well maybe you should put some ice on it.,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Ooh, God it looks bad.",9.1
S04E08,rachel,"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",9.1
S04E08,monica,"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",9.1
S04E08,chandler,He’s really picky about his patients.,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",9.1
S04E08,monica,Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7.,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?",9.1
S04E08,monica,Yes!!,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,Yes! She’s very excited about that.,9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions.",9.1
S04E08,ross,"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",9.1
S04E08,phoebe,All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.,9.1
S04E08,ross,"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",9.1
S04E08,ross,"Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",9.1
S04E08,ross,"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",9.1
S04E08,ross,"Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Like?,9.1
S04E08,ross,"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,When was the last time you saw her wear it?,9.1
S04E08,ross,"Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Big dog?,9.1
S04E08,ross,Hey!,9.1
S04E08,joey,Hey!,9.1
S04E08,ross,What are you doing?,9.1
S04E08,joey,I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,9.1
S04E08,ross,Everything? Even the TV?,9.1
S04E08,joey,No! I’m putting that in my room.,9.1
S04E08,ross,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",9.1
S04E08,joey,"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",9.1
S04E08,ross,"That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",9.1
S04E08,joey,Five years.,9.1
S04E08,ross,You’ve sentenced him?!,9.1
S04E08,joey,Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.,9.1
S04E08,ross,"Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",9.1
S04E08,joey,"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",9.1
S04E08,ross,"Oh, who? Me?",9.1
S04E08,joey,Yeah!,9.1
S04E08,ross,Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?,9.1
S04E08,joey,What?,9.1
S04E08,ross,I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.,9.1
S04E08,joey,All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",9.1
S04E08,joey,"Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Hey Joe.,9.1
S04E08,joey,NA,9.1
S04E08,monica,Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?,9.1
S04E08,rachel,"Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.",9.1
S04E08,monica,"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,Hey! I’m sorry! That— where are you going?,9.1
S04E08,joey,My folks.,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",9.1
S04E08,joey,I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.,9.1
S04E08,chandler,What?!,9.1
S04E08,joey,"Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",9.1
S04E08,joey,"Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya.",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",9.1
S04E08,joey,Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",9.1
S04E08,joey,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",9.1
S04E08,chandler,What?,9.1
S04E08,joey,"Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",9.1
S04E08,chandler,"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?",9.1
S04E08,joey,We’ve got a box.,9.1
S04E08,monica,I was probably waiting for it to open.,9.1
S04E08,monica,You look great too.,9.1
S04E08,monica,So how does it look?,9.1
S04E08,monica,Like a pirate?!,9.1
S04E08,monica,"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  Come on, one of us had to mention him.",9.1
S04E08,monica,Oh. Big family dinner tonight?,9.1
S04E08,monica,No way!,9.1
S04E08,monica,Oh.,9.1
S04E08,monica,Oh.,9.1
S04E08,monica,"So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",9.1
S04E08,monica,I know.,9.1
S04E08,ross,He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!,9.1
S04E08,rachel,"I know, it’s sick.",9.1
S04E08,monica,Why is it sick?,9.1
S04E08,rachel,Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!,9.1
S04E08,monica,"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",9.1
S04E08,phoebe,"Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",9.1
S04E08,ross,Yeah.,9.1
S04E08,joey,What’s twisted?,9.1
S04E08,monica,Me going out with Richard’s son.,9.1
S04E08,joey,Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!,9.1
S04E08,chandler,Sounds like a really bad idea to me.,9.1
S04E08,rachel,Is he okay in there?,9.1
S04E08,joey,He’s fine!,9.1
S04E08,ross,"Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.",9.1
S04E08,monica,"Fine! Judge all you want to but,",9.1
S04E08,rachel,"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",9.1
S04E08,joey,Chandler?,9.1
S04E08,chandler,"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it hurts!",9.1
S04E08,ross,"Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",9.1
S04E08,rachel,Why?,9.1

S04E08,ross,"The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.",9.1
S04E08,rachel,"Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.",9.1
S04E08,ross,Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!,9.1
S04E08,rachel,Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?,9.1
S04E08,ross,What did you get?,9.1
S04E08,rachel,Credit.,9.1
S04E08,monica,"Hi, Tim.",9.1

S04E09,phoebe,"I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and…  You got the job!!",7.9
S04E09,rachel,Yes!!!,7.9

S04E09,rachel,"Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything.  I’m gonna have walls!",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,"Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",7.9
S04E09,monica,"Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that.  Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,But we’ve only had one job.,7.9
S04E09,monica,"I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?",7.9

S04E09,monica,I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.,7.9
S04E09,phoebe,What?,7.9
S04E09,monica,"It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!,7.9
S04E09,monica,"All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here.,7.9

S04E09,chandler,"Yeah, all right.",7.9
S04E09,ross,Okay.,7.9
S04E09,joey,"So, we’re having fun, right?",7.9
S04E09,joey,"We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",7.9
S04E09,ross,I’m kinda beat.,7.9
S04E09,chandler,"Actually, me too.",7.9

S04E09,ross,"Yeah, me too.",7.9
S04E09,chandler,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",7.9
S04E09,joey,"I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",7.9
S04E09,ross,"I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",7.9
S04E09,ross,How sad are we?,7.9
S04E09,joey,"Yeah, I know.",7.9
S04E09,chandler,"Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",7.9
S04E09,joey,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,7.9
S04E09,ross,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",7.9
S04E09,joey,"We’re 29, we’re not women.",7.9
S04E09,monica,"Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,"Okay, I’m hearing.",7.9

S04E09,phoebe,I wa-I wa-I wa…,7.9
S04E09,monica,Pizza?!,7.9
S04E09,phoebe,Monica!,7.9
S04E09,monica,"All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,No.,7.9
S04E09,monica,"Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,No.,7.9
S04E09,monica,"Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.",7.9
S04E09,phoebe,Really?! Are you sure?,7.9
S04E09,monica,"Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.",7.9

S04E09,monica,Really?!,7.9
S04E09,phoebe,"Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",7.9
S04E09,monica,Thank you.,7.9
S04E09,phoebe,"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",7.9
S04E09,rachel,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",7.9
S04E09,rachel,Heard what?,7.9
S04E09,rachel,Oh my God! How?!,7.9
S04E09,rachel,"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",7.9
S04E09,rachel,"Oh, God. Oh, God.  Oh God.",7.9
S04E09,rachel,"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",7.9
S04E09,rachel,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",7.9
S04E09,rachel,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…",7.9
S04E09,monica,"Umm, I just wanna say, uh  Are you gonna kill me?",7.9

S04E10,phoebe,"No, answer his.",8.1
S04E10,ross,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,8.1
S04E10,ross,"No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,8.1
S04E10,joey,"Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now?",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Hey, look at this!  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.,8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",8.1
S04E10,joey,"Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?,8.1

S04E10,monica,"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",8.1

S04E10,monica,"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Hey, honey! What’s the matter?  Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",8.1
S04E10,monica,I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.,8.1
S04E10,joey,Ohhh!,8.1
S04E10,monica,"I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",8.1
S04E10,monica,"I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",8.1
S04E10,joey,"Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",8.1
S04E10,monica,"That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",8.1
S04E10,joey,Good enough to get fired.,8.1
S04E10,monica,"All right, you’re hired!",8.1
S04E10,joey,Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?,8.1
S04E10,chandler,Yes.,8.1
S04E10,chandler,"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",8.1

S04E10,phoebe,I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,8.1
S04E10,joey,What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.,8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",8.1

S04E10,chandler,"It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…",8.1
S04E10,joey,"Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"No! No, the robots just work for them.",8.1
S04E10,monica,"All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",8.1
S04E10,joey,"Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",8.1
S04E10,monica,You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,8.1
S04E10,joey,"Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",8.1

S04E10,ross,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,8.1
S04E10,chandler,Yeah.,8.1
S04E10,ross,"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",8.1
S04E10,ross,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",8.1
S04E10,joey,Hey!,8.1
S04E10,ross,Hey!,8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Hey, man!",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",8.1

S04E10,chandler,"Well, like father, like son.",8.1
S04E10,rachel,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,8.1
S04E10,chandler,Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.,8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Ummmmmmmm, no.",8.1
S04E10,rachel,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!,8.1
S04E10,chandler,Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.,8.1

S04E10,monica,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",8.1
S04E10,joey,"Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",8.1
S04E10,joey,There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!,8.1
S04E10,monica,"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",8.1
S04E10,monica,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,8.1
S04E10,monica,"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",8.1
S04E10,monica,"Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",8.1
S04E10,joey,No ma’am.,8.1

S04E10,joey,"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, \Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!\""",8.1
S04E10,monica,"Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",8.1
S04E10,joey,"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",8.1
S04E10,monica,What kinda things have you been saying?,8.1
S04E10,joey,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…",8.1

S04E10,phoebe,"So, did you pick one yet?",8.1
S04E10,ross,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",8.1
S04E10,ross,"Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.",8.1
S04E10,phoebe,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",8.1

S04E10,rachel,You idiot!!,8.1
S04E10,chandler,"I’m sure you’re right, but why?",8.1
S04E10,rachel,You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",8.1
S04E10,chandler,I know! I know!,8.1
S04E10,rachel,"Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!",8.1
S04E10,chandler,"Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once.",8.1

S04E12,monica,I can’t believe we’re living here!,9.5
S04E12,chandler,What?! What-what is it?!,9.5
S04E12,joey,Did you see the size of the closets?!,9.5

S04E13,ross,Dude!,8.2
S04E13,ross,Here’s your girlfriend’s button.,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?",8.2
S04E13,monica,"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.",8.2
S04E13,monica,"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department.,8.2
S04E13,monica,"Oh my God, are you out of a job?",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?,8.2
S04E13,rachel,Uh-huh.,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,That sounds great!,8.2
S04E13,joey,NA,8.2
S04E13,monica,"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",8.2
S04E13,joey,There’s gravy?,8.2
S04E13,monica,"If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.",8.2
S04E13,monica,What are you doing?,8.2
S04E13,joey,I think I left a donut up here.,8.2
S04E13,ross,Hey!,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Hey!,8.2
S04E13,joey,Hey!,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?,8.2
S04E13,ross,"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,That’s a good idea for a business!,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, \So where’s your boyfriend",8.2
S04E13,joey,That-that is a good trick.,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",8.2
S04E13,joey,Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.,8.2
S04E13,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",8.2
S04E13,ross,They’re not a couple!,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Oh-okay, I get the game now.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",8.2
S04E13,ross,Oh yeah!,8.2
S04E13,joey,"Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,Really?,8.2
S04E13,joey,"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",8.2
S04E13,ross,No.,8.2
S04E13,joey,Noooo!!,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Yeah, I know but…",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Oh no-no-no, I’m there.",8.2
S04E13,monica,Hey!,8.2
S04E13,joey,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?,8.2
S04E13,monica,You made pancakes?,8.2
S04E13,joey,Yep! Grab a plate.,8.2
S04E13,monica,Okay.,8.2
S04E13,joey,"No-no, stay right there.  Gettin’ closer.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",8.2
S04E13,ross,Oh yeah!,8.2
S04E13,monica,"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Oh yeah, who’s playing?",8.2
S04E13,monica,The players.,8.2
S04E13,ross,Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.,8.2
S04E13,monica,"Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Oh.,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Hi!,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Oh, I’m so sorry.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Well, at least that’s a great suit.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"No-no, that wasn’t me!  The selection of underwear we carry.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",8.2
S04E13,ross,"All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.",8.2
S04E13,ross,Hey!,8.2
S04E13,ross,"Oh, absolutely!",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Okay, I…",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Well, you can understand, given how we started.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Rachel has a new doll.,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Uh, hello!",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Hi-e!!,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Ooh, what do I smell?",8.2
S04E13,joey,"I don’t know, it smells good.",8.2
S04E13,monica,Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!,8.2

S04E13,ross,"Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,What? What?,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?",8.2
S04E13,rachel,It’s Joshua.,8.2
S04E13,ross,"Oh, whatever.",8.2
S04E13,monica,Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Well, I hate to eat and run, but…",8.2
S04E13,monica,"No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Yeah, I don’t need it.",8.2
S04E13,monica,People are supposed to wanna hang out here!,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",8.2
S04E13,monica,"I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",8.2
S04E13,monica,"‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Yeah, that’s true.",8.2
S04E13,monica,"All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Oh, are we gonna trash that place?",8.2
S04E13,chandler,Steps!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!,8.2
S04E13,ross,So you were right?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it!",8.2
S04E13,ross,Chandler!,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Chandler, what did she say?",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Wait a minute.,8.2
S04E13,joey,Come here.,8.2
S04E13,monica,Are you sure?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Beefsteak Charlie’s?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,Yes! See you and I have always been like—,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",8.2

S04E13,rachel,"Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Hi!,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Why don’t you ask him out?,8.2
S04E13,joey,"Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?,8.2
S04E13,joey,"Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,He just got a divorce right?,8.2
S04E13,rachel,Hmm-mmm.,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,You’ve never asked a guy out?!!,8.2
S04E13,rachel,No. Have you?,8.2
S04E13,phoebe,Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?,8.2
S04E13,rachel,I don’t even know how I would go about it.,8.2
S04E13,joey,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \Hey",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,"Oh, please!",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Hey, how you doin’?",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  You’ve done that a thousand times?",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,I’ve never done that.,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Really?! You think that will work?,8.2
S04E13,joey,"Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",8.2
S04E13,joey,What the heck is that?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,Did she call?,8.2

S04E13,chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",8.2
S04E13,ross,"He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",8.2
S04E13,ross,How might you be wrong?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",8.2
S04E13,ross,That’s all you’re basing this on?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",8.2
S04E13,joey,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,Oh my God!!,8.2

S04E13,rachel,Really?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me— Nick’s pants?",8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",8.2

S04E13,monica,"Pretty much.  So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?",8.2
S04E13,joey,"I don’t know, it looks the same.",8.2
S04E13,monica,You used to have carpet.,8.2
S04E13,joey,Oh yeah!,8.2
S04E13,monica,"So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.",8.2

S04E13,phoebe,Oh good!,8.2
S04E13,chandler,She is now.,8.2
S04E13,ross,What are you saying?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",8.2
S04E13,phoebe,How? How is your fault?,8.2
S04E13,chandler,"Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",8.2
S04E13,ross,"Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…",8.2
S04E13,rachel,Really?,8.2
S04E13,rachel,"Yes! I will! Absolutely!  Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?",8.2

S04E14,chandler,You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.,8.2
S04E14,monica,"Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?",8.2
S04E14,joey,"Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",8.2
S04E14,monica,What’s Phase Two?,8.2
S04E14,joey,Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.,8.2
S04E14,rachel,How does going to a strip club help him better?,8.2
S04E14,ross,Because there are naked ladies there.,8.2
S04E14,joey,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",8.2
S04E14,ross,There are naked ladies there too.,8.2

S04E14,monica,So you hit her in the face?,8.2
S04E14,rachel,"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",8.2

S04E15,chandler,"Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was gonna be fun!  Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!",8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman!  Hi. How are ya?,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",8.5
S04E15,rachel,Hmm.,8.5
S04E15,monica,Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?,8.5
S04E15,joey,"Ohh, Nothing.",8.5
S04E15,monica,Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?,8.5
S04E15,joey,I know what it did! Nothing.,8.5
S04E15,monica,They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?,8.5
S04E15,joey,Like this.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?",8.5
S04E15,joey,Sure! It flushes it.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?",8.5
S04E15,chandler,Hello!,8.5
S04E15,joey,Hey!,8.5
S04E15,rachel,Guess who we ran into today?!,8.5
S04E15,monica,Janice?!,8.5

S04E15,chandler,Bye.,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,What?! I thought you were crazy about her!,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",8.5
S04E15,joey,So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!,8.5
S04E15,chandler,Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.,8.5
S04E15,chandler,NA,8.5
S04E15,joey,"Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  I’m tellin’ ya!",8.5

S04E15,ross,Help! Help!! Help! Help!!,8.5
S04E15,ross,"Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?  Help! Help!",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it  football?",8.5
S04E15,ross,"What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…",8.5
S04E15,ross,Cheers!,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…",8.5
S04E15,chandler,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"No! No! Not, Paris.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",8.5

S04E15,chandler,But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.,8.5
S04E15,monica,Done?,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,Yep!,8.5
S04E15,rachel,Hey!,8.5
S04E15,joey,Hey! What’s up?,8.5
S04E15,monica,"This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",8.5
S04E15,joey,I bet I stopped listening before you did.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",8.5
S04E15,monica,"Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go.",8.5
S04E15,rachel,It’s coming from Joey!,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!",8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.",8.5
S04E15,ross,Hey!,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,Janice.,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Hey-hey, what’s going on?",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.",8.5
S04E15,joey,Thanks for telling me!,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Joey, trade lives with me!",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Hey, I can handle it! All right?",8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",8.5
S04E15,ross,That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.,8.5
S04E15,joey,"Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?",8.5
S04E15,joey,Ross!  They’re gonna kill you!,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Well, why are you doing this anyway?",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.",8.5
S04E15,phoebe,You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.,8.5
S04E15,ross,"Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!",8.5
S04E15,rachel,"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.",8.5
S04E15,joey,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",8.5
S04E15,chandler,Thanks!,8.5
S04E15,ross,"Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.",8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",8.5
S04E15,joey,Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy . And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!,8.5
S04E15,ross,They don’t look any bigger than me!,8.5
S04E15,joey,"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",8.5
S04E15,ross,All right.,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,Hi.,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,Whoa!  I kinda liked it.,8.5
S04E15,ross,"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!",8.5
S04E15,joey,I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.,8.5
S04E15,ross,Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!,8.5
S04E15,joey,No.,8.5
S04E15,ross,You’ll see.,8.5
S04E15,ross,JOEY!!!!!!,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?",8.5
S04E15,monica,He asked you out?!,8.5
S04E15,rachel,No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.,8.5
S04E15,monica,Saucy!,8.5
S04E15,rachel,What are these?,8.5
S04E15,monica,Electrical plans for the building.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",8.5
S04E15,monica,"I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",8.5
S04E15,rachel,Wow! If only more people knew.,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then.  Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"No. All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,American Express?,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?",8.5
S04E15,ross,Thanks.  I-I think I’m dying. I really do.,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Oh, poor baby.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!",8.5
S04E15,ross,That’s not true!,8.5
S04E15,phoebe,She’s right! You have to stop!,8.5
S04E15,ross,"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!",8.5
S04E15,ross,I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!,8.5
S04E15,ross,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",8.5
S04E15,ross,I like that.,8.5
S04E15,ross,Huh?,8.5
S04E15,ross,"All right, bad ankle, got it!",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",8.5
S04E15,ross,"But-but, Liam’s on my team.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!",8.5
S04E15,joey,The Red Ross! Okay.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,Hey!,8.5
S04E15,monica,Hi!,8.5
S04E15,rachel,What-what are-what are these?,8.5
S04E15,monica,"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?",8.5
S04E15,monica,"No-no-no, no!",8.5
S04E15,monica,"I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",8.5
S04E15,rachel,Oh my God! Look at this!,8.5
S04E15,monica,"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!",8.5
S04E15,rachel,I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!,8.5
S04E15,monica,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,And did you?!,8.5
S04E15,monica,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",8.5
S04E15,monica,But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,Oh my God.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Yeah, sure.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"No, not you.",8.5
S04E15,joey,"Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.",8.5
S04E15,phoebe,"Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?",8.5
S04E15,ross,"I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.",8.5
S04E15,ross,"It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",8.5
S04E15,chandler,No!,8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",8.5
S04E15,chandler,"Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",8.5
S04E15,monica,All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.,8.5
S04E15,rachel,Thank God.,8.5
S04E15,monica,"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.",8.5
S04E15,phoebe,See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.,8.5
S04E16,monica,What is it hon?,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!  No.",8.2
S04E16,monica,"Aww, honey I’m sorry.",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!,8.2
S04E16,chandler,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.,8.2
S04E16,joey,Yeah?,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?",8.2
S04E16,joey,Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,No!,8.2
S04E16,joey,Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe it’s a pickle?!",8.2
S04E16,chandler,What are you writing?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",8.2
S04E16,chandler,Oh yeah?  never go out of style—what did you throw away?,8.2
S04E16,chandler,Hi guys!,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Hey, what have you guys been up too?",8.2
S04E16,ross,"Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.",8.2
S04E16,chandler,Without me?!,8.2
S04E16,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S04E16,monica,"I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.",8.2
S04E16,ross,Bye.,8.2
S04E16,joey,Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.,8.2
S04E16,ross,"Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.",8.2
S04E16,monica,"Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.",8.2
S04E16,ross,"Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.",8.2
S04E16,joey,Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.,8.2
S04E16,chandler,"Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.",8.2
S04E16,ross,Pheebs!,8.2
S04E16,ross,Hello! Hello!,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.",8.2
S04E16,chandler,Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,Yeah?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Well, that’s because of a lot of…",8.2
S04E16,rachel,I know!,8.2
S04E16,rachel,Oh?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Well, congratulations, so do you love her?",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",8.2
S04E16,chandler,What are you talking about?,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Yeah, what’ going on?",8.2
S04E16,rachel,We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.,8.2
S04E16,ross,"Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.",8.2
S04E16,joey,Awwww!,8.2
S04E16,rachel,Surprise!!!,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Well, it was all Ross’s idea.",8.2
S04E16,ross,You really didn’t know?,8.2
S04E16,chandler,Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.",8.2
S04E16,chandler,Like what?,8.2
S04E16,joey,What-what-what is so funny?,8.2
S04E16,chandler,"I said, \Like what?\""",8.2
S04E16,joey,Now that’s a thinker.,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries.  Hi!",8.2
S04E16,rachel,Care for a cherry?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.",8.2
S04E16,ross,So we should probably get going soon.,8.2
S04E16,ross,"Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.",8.2
S04E16,ross,"No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, \Surprise!\"" And then",8.2
S04E16,ross,Monica said that did she?,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",8.2
S04E16,joey,A little salami.,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?",8.2

S04E16,joey,Yeah.,8.2
S04E16,rachel,Up!,8.2
S04E16,monica,You changed?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.",8.2
S04E16,monica,"And lucky means, more cleavage?",8.2
S04E16,chandler,Does for me.,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?",8.2
S04E16,joey,"Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.",8.2

S04E16,monica,"Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,It’s not Christmas!,8.2
S04E16,monica,Or Spin the Bottle?,8.2

S04E16,rachel,"No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!",8.2
S04E16,ross,What big thing?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,All right. Who wants to go first?,8.2
S04E16,joey,Welcome to America.,8.2
S04E16,monica,Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now!,8.2

S04E16,rachel,"All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,Just a bug.,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.",8.2
S04E16,chandler,Okay.,8.2
S04E16,chandler,There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.,8.2
S04E16,joey,"All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Yeah, totally!",8.2

S04E16,joey,Feel better now?,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.",8.2
S04E16,joey,"Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,What?,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,Yeah.,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,"Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",8.2
S04E16,joey,"Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",8.2
S04E16,ross,"Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.",8.2
S04E16,monica,Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",8.2

S04E16,rachel,But….,8.2
S04E16,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.",8.2
S04E16,ross,"That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.",8.2
S04E16,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",8.2
S04E16,ross,Helps a little.,8.2
S04E16,rachel,Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?,8.2
S04E16,ross,"Yeah, have a seat.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,I’m so sorry.,8.2
S04E16,ross,"That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?",8.2
S04E16,ross,What do you mean?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,You seem to really like her.,8.2
S04E16,ross,"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",8.2
S04E16,ross,You think?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",8.2
S04E16,ross,"Hey, you’re right.",8.2
S04E16,rachel,Yeah.,8.2
S04E16,ross,Thanks.  What photo album was it?,8.2
S04E16,rachel,"I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.",8.2
S04E16,ross,"Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!",8.2
S04E16,rachel,Hey.,8.2
S04E16,chandler,Hey.,8.2

S04E16,rachel,"Oh my gosh, Joshua!",8.2

S04E16,phoebe,"Hm-mm, corn beef.",8.2
S04E16,joey,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,Okay.,8.2
S04E16,joey,Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?,8.2
S04E16,phoebe,Six months.,8.2
S04E16,joey,"Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?",8.2
S04E16,phoebe,Not if I get there first.,8.2
S04E17,joey,What is that?,8.6
S04E17,chandler,Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.,8.6
S04E17,joey,Maybe he found you flip-flop.,8.6
S04E17,chandler,Hey!,8.6
S04E17,joey,Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.,8.6
S04E17,chandler,Do we pay for this?,8.6
S04E17,joey,"No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.",8.6
S04E17,chandler,Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.,8.6
S04E17,joey,Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill?,8.6
S04E17,chandler,"Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",8.6
S04E17,chandler,Like finding money with naked people on it!,8.6
S04E17,joey,NA,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?",8.6
S04E17,chandler,We don’t know what could make this go away.,8.6
S04E17,joey,"Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",8.6
S04E17,chandler,And no one touches the air around the TV!,8.6
S04E17,joey,"Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?",8.6
S04E17,monica,"Well at least, I’m going to mute it.",8.6
S04E17,chandler,We still have porn.,8.6
S04E17,joey,Hey.,8.6

S04E17,rachel,Give it here.,8.6
S04E17,monica,Okay.,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.",8.6
S04E17,chandler,Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,You mean like a doctor?,8.6
S04E17,joey,Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Ohh!  Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.",8.6
S04E17,ross,Hi.,8.6
S04E17,monica,Hi.,8.6
S04E17,ross,"So uh, Emily just went to the airport.",8.6
S04E17,monica,Oh. Why didn’t you take her?,8.6
S04E17,ross,"Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…",8.6
S04E17,monica,You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!,8.6
S04E17,ross,Nah.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?",8.6
S04E17,ross,"Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  \This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…\""",8.6
S04E17,monica,"No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.",8.6
S04E17,ross,And why do you care so much?,8.6
S04E17,monica,Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!,8.6
S04E17,ross,You had fantasies about Emily?,8.6
S04E17,monica,"No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",8.6
S04E17,ross,Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",8.6
S04E17,ross,Ahh.,8.6
S04E17,monica,Do you love her?,8.6
S04E17,ross,"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?",8.6
S04E17,monica,You love her!,8.6
S04E17,ross,What-what is love really?,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, \I love you!\"" And she’s gonna say",8.6
S04E17,ross,I am a good kisser.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.",8.6
S04E17,rachel,Is that the heartbeat?,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Oh my God!,8.6
S04E17,rachel,Oh wow! This is so cool.,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Well, yeah.",8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,What do you know?!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Ooh! Hi!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, \Oh",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"No, back to happy. Back to happy!",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,You can’t give up on your dream.,8.6
S04E17,ross,Emily!,8.6
S04E17,ross,"I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.",8.6
S04E17,ross,"That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar.  I had the most amazing time with you.",8.6
S04E17,ross,"Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.",8.6
S04E17,ross,That’s no problem.,8.6
S04E17,rachel,What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.,8.6
S04E17,chandler,It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.,8.6
S04E17,rachel,Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.,8.6
S04E17,joey,Yeah right.,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",8.6
S04E17,chandler,"Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?",8.6
S04E17,rachel,Yes!,8.6
S04E17,joey,"Yeah, he likes porn.",8.6
S04E17,monica,Where ya going?,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.  Hey, Pheebs!",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Hey.,8.6
S04E17,joey,Hey!,8.6
S04E17,monica,How did it go with Frank and Alice?,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",8.6
S04E17,chandler,They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.,8.6
S04E17,monica,Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?,8.6
S04E17,ross,I did.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"And well, what did she say?",8.6
S04E17,ross,Thank you.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?",8.6
S04E17,ross,"She said, \Thank you.\"" I said",8.6
S04E17,chandler,"Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",8.6
S04E17,joey,"Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",8.6
S04E17,ross,What do I do now?,8.6
S04E17,joey,You play hard to get.,8.6
S04E17,ross,She already lives in London.,8.6
S04E17,joey,Then you go to Tokyo.,8.6
S04E17,chandler,"All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.",8.6
S04E17,monica,It is not over! You’re over!,8.6
S04E17,chandler,What?,8.6
S04E17,monica,You know!,8.6
S04E17,chandler,Okay.  Good one.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!",8.6
S04E17,ross,"Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.",8.6
S04E17,joey,"Way to be strong, man!",8.6
S04E17,rachel,Hey!,8.6
S04E17,chandler,"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?",8.6
S04E17,chandler,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.",8.6
S04E17,monica,Hey!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Hi!,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Well, what-what ‘cha got there?",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Oh this, well I’m glad you asked.  Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking…",8.6
S04E17,chandler,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,No!,8.6
S04E17,monica,Are you sure?,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,No!,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",8.6
S04E17,chandler,What’s the second part of your plan?,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,My Saturn dealership.,8.6
S04E17,ross,Hello?,8.6
S04E17,ross,"Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?",8.6
S04E17,ross,"No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.",8.6
S04E17,ross,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?,8.6
S04E17,ross,"She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.",8.6
S04E17,monica,"This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.",8.6
S04E17,ross,Well…,8.6
S04E17,monica,Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!,8.6
S04E17,ross,"I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!",8.6
S04E17,chandler,You put your fist through the wall?,8.6
S04E17,ross,"No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!",8.6
S04E17,monica,You have to go to London!,8.6
S04E17,ross,What?,8.6
S04E17,monica,"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!",8.6
S04E17,joey,"Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!",8.6
S04E17,monica,"When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?",8.6
S04E17,ross,I made fun of his accent.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?",8.6
S04E17,ross,No.,8.6
S04E17,monica,"All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!",8.6
S04E17,ross,Really?,8.6
S04E17,monica,Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!,8.6
S04E17,ross,"All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!",8.6
S04E17,monica,All right.,8.6
S04E17,ross,"I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.",8.6
S04E17,monica,"Okay, good luck!",8.6
S04E17,joey,"Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?",8.6
S04E17,rachel,Hey!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!,8.6
S04E17,monica,"That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?",8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,I’m telling it! I’m telling it!,8.6
S04E17,rachel,Okay.,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?",8.6
S04E17,chandler,A place where no one will ever get out alive?,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,"No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…",8.6
S04E17,rachel,Relaxi-Taxi!,8.6
S04E17,phoebe,The name was my favourite part!,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Well, well I can up with it!",8.6
S04E17,phoebe,YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.,8.6
S04E17,rachel,"Well, I…",8.6

S04E18,phoebe,"Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.",8.3
S04E18,ross,"Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.",8.3
S04E18,rachel,Huh.,8.3
S04E18,ross,What?,8.3
S04E18,rachel,"She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",8.3
S04E18,monica,This totally makes sense!,8.3
S04E18,ross,It does not!,8.3
S04E18,monica,"Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",8.3

S04E18,monica,This is so much fun!,8.3

S04E18,chandler,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",8.3
S04E18,phoebe,You’re actually going through with this?,8.3
S04E18,chandler,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",8.3
S04E18,phoebe,"You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",8.3

S04E20,monica,"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",8.5
S04E20,rachel,"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",8.5
S04E20,phoebe,"Yeah, maybe.",8.5
S04E20,rachel,And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,8.5

S04E22,phoebe,Oh!,8.5
S04E22,rachel,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…",8.5
S04E22,phoebe,"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",8.5
S04E22,rachel,"Well, h-how is this like that?",8.5
S04E22,phoebe,"Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…",8.5
S04E22,rachel,"I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…",8.5
S04E22,phoebe,"Alrighty, here come the water works.",8.5
S04E22,joey,"Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",8.5
S04E22,ross,Hey guys!,8.5
S04E22,chandler,Hey!,8.5
S04E22,joey,Hey…,8.5

S04E22,joey,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!",8.5
S04E22,ross,"Yeah, right!",8.5
S04E22,joey,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…",8.5
S04E22,ross,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",8.5
S04E22,chandler,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",8.5
S04E22,ross,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",8.5
S04E22,chandler,"So you might say, it’s a magic ring.",8.5
S04E22,joey,"Yeah, the stripper stole it.",8.5
S04E22,ross,My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!,8.5

S04E22,joey,"Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",8.5
S04E22,ross,Not on you! On the stripper!,8.5
S04E22,joey,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.",8.5
S04E22,ross,"Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!",8.5
S04E22,joey,"I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, \If I bothered them again they’d call the police.\"" I said",8.5
S04E22,ross,"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!",8.5
S04E22,joey,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…",8.5
S04E22,chandler,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?",8.5
S04E22,joey,"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",8.5
S04E22,monica,Here’s your tea Phoebe.,8.5

S04E22,phoebe,"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.",8.5
S04E22,monica,"Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!",8.5
S04E22,rachel,"Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!",8.5
S04E22,phoebe,"No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",8.5
S04E22,monica,"Rachel, get the book! The book!",8.5
S04E22,rachel,Okay!  Okay! Here!,8.5

S04E22,rachel,I don’t know!,8.5
S04E22,joey,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.",8.5

S04E22,phoebe,"Well, do you see any babies?",8.5
S04E22,monica,How do you feel?,8.5
S04E22,phoebe,"Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.",8.5
S04E22,rachel,"Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.",8.5
S04E22,phoebe,"I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.",8.5
S04E22,monica,Some moms do that.,8.5

S04E22,phoebe,"Yeah, okay.",8.5
S04E22,rachel,"No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?",8.5
S04E22,monica,"I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.",8.5

S04E23,monica,Chicken Kiev?,8.7
S04E23,ross,Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?,8.7
S04E23,monica,"Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!",8.7

S04E23,phoebe,"Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",8.7
S04E23,rachel,I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",8.7
S04E23,rachel,Still in love with?!,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,Yeah!,8.7
S04E23,rachel,I’m not in love with Ross!,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",8.7
S04E23,rachel,"Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",8.7
S04E23,phoebe,We thought you knew!,8.7
S04E23,rachel,We?!,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",8.7
S04E23,rachel,You all know? Does Ross know?,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.",8.7
S04E23,rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!",8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, \Hey",8.7
S04E23,joey,Hey!,8.7
S04E23,joey,Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?,8.7
S04E23,chandler,"Well, I don’t have to buy that, \I’m with stupid\"" T-shirt anymore.""",8.7
S04E23,joey,"Well, I like it. Here you go.",8.7
S04E23,chandler,"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",8.7
S04E23,joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?",8.7
S04E23,chandler,How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,8.7
S04E23,chandler,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,8.7
S04E23,chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",8.7
S04E23,joey,Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,8.7
S04E23,joey,Thanks.,8.7
S04E23,chandler,"Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!",8.7
S04E23,ross,"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",8.7
S04E23,ross,Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,8.7
S04E23,ross,She said what?,8.7
S04E23,ross,"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn’t right.",8.7
S04E23,ross,I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,8.7
S04E23,ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.,8.7
S04E23,ross,No. I’m saying it’s now.,8.7
S04E23,ross,There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,8.7
S04E23,ross,NA,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,Hey!,8.7
S04E23,rachel,Hi.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",8.7
S04E23,rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him.",8.7
S04E23,rachel,You can?,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,8.7
S04E23,rachel,Um-hmm.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.,8.7
S04E23,rachel,Okay.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,And a glass of tepid water.,8.7
S04E23,rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",8.7
S04E23,rachel,I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?",8.7
S04E23,rachel,"I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",8.7
S04E23,rachel,Okay.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,Okay?,8.7
S04E23,rachel,All right.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture…",8.7
S04E23,rachel,Okay.,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"All right, and umm…",8.7
S04E23,rachel,Ow!,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?",8.7
S04E23,rachel,"Well, I like you less!",8.7
S04E23,joey,Hey.,8.7
S04E23,chandler,Hey.,8.7
S04E23,joey,Oh.  Sorry!,8.7
S04E23,chandler,"No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.",8.7
S04E23,joey,Me too.,8.7
S04E23,chandler,Yeah?,8.7
S04E23,joey,"Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",8.7
S04E23,monica,Hey!,8.7
S04E23,joey,Sh-shh-shh!,8.7

S04E23,joey,"Oh, Chandler.",8.7
S04E23,chandler,That’s… That’s was…,8.7
S04E23,monica,Oh my God!,8.7
S04E23,joey,That’s Fergie baby!!,8.7
S04E23,chandler,How did you? How? How?,8.7
S04E23,joey,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!",8.7
S04E23,monica,Hey!,8.7
S04E23,ross,Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.,8.7
S04E23,monica,"Yes, I did! And you are welcome!",8.7
S04E23,ross,Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!,8.7
S04E23,monica,Umm…,8.7
S04E23,chandler,I’m gonna go to the bathroom.,8.7
S04E23,joey,Wait up!,8.7
S04E23,ross,"Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?",8.7
S04E23,monica,She said that?!,8.7
S04E23,ross,Yeah.,8.7
S04E23,monica,Why?!,8.7
S04E23,ross,"I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.",8.7
S04E23,monica,Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!,8.7
S04E23,ross,Excuse me?,8.7
S04E23,monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",8.7
S04E23,ross,I don’t know. A month?,8.7
S04E23,monica,"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",8.7
S04E23,ross,"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",8.7
S04E23,monica,Sometimes we were.,8.7
S04E23,ross,Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?,8.7
S04E23,monica,Okay.,8.7
S04E23,ross,Come on.,8.7
S04E23,chandler,That was pretty intense huh?,8.7
S04E23,joey,"Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",8.7
S04E23,chandler,I hope he did!,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,Hello.,8.7
S04E23,joey,"Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!",8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",8.7
S04E23,joey,"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",8.7
S04E23,joey,"Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.",8.7

S04E23,monica,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here  You go.",8.7
S04E23,ross,"But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.",8.7
S04E23,ross,"And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…",8.7

S04E23,phoebe,"I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!",8.7

S04E23,phoebe,"That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, \Yeah",8.7
S04E23,rachel,Ohh—Do you think he will?!,8.7
S04E23,phoebe,"No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",8.7
S04E23,rachel,"Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, \I do.\""",8.7

S05E03,rachel,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?",8.8
S05E03,monica,Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.,8.8
S05E03,rachel,"What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.",8.8
S05E03,monica,"Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.",8.8
S05E03,rachel,What?,8.8
S05E03,monica,Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?,8.8
S05E03,rachel,"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.",8.8
S05E03,joey,Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…,8.8
S05E03,rachel,"Joey, how do you make that dirty?",8.8
S05E03,joey,"Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad…",8.8
S05E03,joey,NA,8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.",8.8
S05E03,ross,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?",8.8
S05E03,joey,"Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.",8.8
S05E03,chandler,Really? Male nurses?,8.8
S05E03,joey,"Yeah, I was bummed too.",8.8
S05E03,chandler,So they're going on dates? When?,8.8
S05E03,joey,I think Saturday—.,8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,Hey.,8.8
S05E03,chandler,"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?",8.8
S05E03,chandler,All right.,8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!",8.8
S05E03,ross,"To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!,8.8
S05E03,ross,"Again, it's not that he…",8.8
S05E03,chandler,Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!,8.8
S05E03,monica,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.",8.8
S05E03,chandler,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.",8.8
S05E03,monica,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.",8.8
S05E03,chandler,Fine! Maybe I will too!,8.8
S05E03,joey,NA,8.8
S05E03,ross,"Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,Hi! And you're going into what grade?,8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!",8.8
S05E03,joey,"Umm, well, what else could it be?",8.8

S05E03,rachel,"Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?",8.8
S05E03,rachel,"Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Oh, just ask him!",8.8
S05E03,rachel,Me?!,8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!",8.8
S05E03,rachel,No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!,8.8
S05E03,phoebe,You're right.,8.8

S05E03,chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",8.8
S05E03,monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",8.8
S05E03,chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.",8.8
S05E03,monica,I think you're better than you think you are.,8.8
S05E03,chandler,"Really? Okay, so…",8.8
S05E03,monica,Know when to stop.,8.8
S05E03,chandler,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",8.8
S05E03,monica,"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.",8.8

S05E03,phoebe,Which one do you have?,8.8
S05E03,monica,I don't care.,8.8
S05E03,rachel,"Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…",8.8
S05E03,rachel,"Yeah, umm, no honey.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,"So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives!",8.8
S05E03,monica,"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!",8.8

S05E03,phoebe,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.,8.8
S05E03,chandler,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,They're gonna call her Chandler.,8.8
S05E03,chandler,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",8.8
S05E03,phoebe,Works on you.,8.8
S05E04,monica,Come in. I've been waiting for you.,8.3
S05E04,rachel,Hi! I just wanna- Oh my God!,8.3
S05E04,monica,"Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.",8.3
S05E04,rachel,"Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work.  I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!",8.3
S05E04,rachel,"That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Uh-huh, that one!",8.3
S05E04,rachel,"Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail.",8.3
S05E04,monica,It's just Joey and Ross.,8.3
S05E04,rachel,Why aren't you guys at the movie?,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",8.3
S05E04,ross,I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!,8.3
S05E04,joey,He's talking to London!,8.3
S05E04,monica,But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",8.3
S05E04,joey,Ross! Way to suck up to the family.,8.3
S05E04,chandler,-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!,8.3
S05E04,joey,Hey!,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!",8.3
S05E04,joey,"Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?",8.3
S05E04,joey,"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!",8.3
S05E04,monica,Oh that's great!,8.3
S05E04,joey,"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Ugh, PBS!",8.3
S05E04,monica,What's wrong with PBS?,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Ugh, what's right with them?",8.3
S05E04,joey,"Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,8.3
S05E04,joey,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",8.3
S05E04,joey,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,What-what are you talking about?!,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Yeah. So?,8.3
S05E04,joey,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Well, may I ask for one example?",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!",8.3
S05E04,joey,That's because all people are selfish.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Are you calling me selfish?!,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.",8.3
S05E04,ross,Hello.,8.3
S05E04,ross,"Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  Hi!",8.3
S05E04,ross,"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!",8.3
S05E04,ross,Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.,8.3
S05E04,ross,She's talking.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",8.3
S05E04,joey,That he doesn't exist.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Right.,8.3
S05E04,rachel,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",8.3
S05E04,rachel,"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",8.3
S05E04,rachel,I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!,8.3
S05E04,chandler,Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?,8.3
S05E04,monica,I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!",8.3
S05E04,ross,Hi!,8.3
S05E04,monica,Hey!,8.3
S05E04,ross,"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,Yes!,8.3
S05E04,monica,That's great!,8.3
S05E04,ross,In London!,8.3
S05E04,monica,What?!,8.3
S05E04,ross,She wants me to move to London.,8.3
S05E04,monica,But you live here!  You know that.,8.3
S05E04,rachel,What-what-what are you gonna do?,8.3
S05E04,ross,I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.,8.3
S05E04,monica,"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",8.3
S05E04,ross,It could happen.,8.3
S05E04,joey,How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!,8.3
S05E04,joey,"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",8.3
S05E04,joey,But I'm the host!,8.3
S05E04,joey,"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",8.3
S05E04,rachel,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",8.3
S05E04,monica,Sure!,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",8.3
S05E04,rachel,Chandler!  Is he?,8.3
S05E04,monica,"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"All right, did you just say all right?",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Yes, tell me.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"I know. I am, I am so sorry.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Again, very sorry.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.",8.3
S05E04,ross,Oh that is so great! That's…,8.3
S05E04,ross,"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,Yes!,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Ooh-ohh!,8.3
S05E04,monica,Great!,8.3
S05E04,ross,No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Why?,8.3
S05E04,monica,What?! You can't—what did you tell her?,8.3
S05E04,ross,"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Yeah.,8.3
S05E04,chandler,That's true!,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,That's true!,8.3
S05E04,monica,"No, you cannot.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Thanks for the help, problem solved.",8.3
S05E04,monica,Hello.,8.3
S05E04,joey,Hey Mon!,8.3
S05E04,monica,"Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?",8.3
S05E04,joey,"See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.",8.3
S05E04,monica,You're not on TV.,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Hey, there he is! There he is!",8.3
S05E04,joey,Hello New York!,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!",8.3
S05E04,monica,Hi Chandler.,8.3
S05E04,chandler,Hey!,8.3
S05E04,monica,"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",8.3
S05E04,monica,"William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Expect it in 4-6 weeks.  Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Yeah, so?",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,Why?,8.3
S05E04,monica,Why?,8.3
S05E04,chandler,What's your point?,8.3
S05E04,joey,PBS telethon.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",8.3
S05E04,joey,What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",8.3
S05E04,joey,"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,NA,8.3
S05E04,joey,"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?",8.3
S05E04,joey,Come on man! You've been here all day!,8.3
S05E04,ross,NA,8.3
S05E04,monica,"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Ooh, it's not a toy.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",8.3
S05E04,monica,"All right, let me see.  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",8.3
S05E04,joey,PBS Telethon.,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,Hi Joey.,8.3
S05E04,joey,Hey Pheebs!,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.,8.3
S05E04,joey,"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",8.3
S05E04,joey,And you don't a little good about donating the money?,8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",8.3
S05E04,joey,"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.",8.3
S05E04,phoebe,"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no!",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.",8.3
S05E04,monica,Keep talking.,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.",8.3
S05E04,monica,Really?,8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!",8.3
S05E04,monica,"Well, if we owe it?  Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.",8.3
S05E04,monica,"But, I just cleaned the bathroom.",8.3
S05E04,chandler,"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.",8.3

S05E04,rachel,"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",8.3
S05E04,ross,"No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.",8.3
S05E04,rachel,"Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!",8.3
S05E04,ross,Thanks.,8.3
S05E04,rachel,"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!",8.3

S05E05,monica,"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",8.8
S05E05,joey,I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.,8.8
S05E05,monica,I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",8.8

S05E05,monica,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.,8.8
S05E05,ross,Hey.,8.8

S05E05,monica,"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",8.8
S05E05,joey,"Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…",8.8
S05E05,phoebe,"Ooh, Madlibs, mine!",8.8
S05E05,chandler,Condoms?,8.8
S05E05,joey,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.,8.8

S05E05,monica,"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,It's Le Poo.,8.8
S05E05,phoebe,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,I can't believe it! We're here!,8.8
S05E05,monica,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Come here.  Okay, be right back.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!",8.8
S05E05,monica,We're switching rooms.,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!",8.8
S05E05,monica,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!",8.8

S05E05,rachel,"Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Okay, great.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,8.8
S05E05,monica,We're switching rooms again.,8.8
S05E05,chandler,What? Why?,8.8
S05E05,monica,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",8.8
S05E05,chandler,Uh-huh.,8.8
S05E05,monica,Chandler!,8.8

S05E05,chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",8.8
S05E05,monica,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",8.8
S05E05,chandler,Do not speak ill of the dead.,8.8
S05E05,monica,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",8.8
S05E05,monica,What did you say?,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"I said, \Geez",8.8

S05E05,rachel,"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",8.8
S05E05,ross,"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…",8.8
S05E05,rachel,Yeah?,8.8
S05E05,ross,…is for me not to see you anymore.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,"That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?  Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",8.8
S05E05,ross,"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",8.8
S05E05,ross,You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",8.8
S05E05,ross,What are you doing?,8.8
S05E05,rachel,Storming out!,8.8
S05E05,ross,"Rachel, this is your apartment.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!",8.8

S05E05,joey,"Hey, how was your chef thing?",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",8.8
S05E05,monica,Chandler!,8.8
S05E05,chandler,Monica.,8.8
S05E05,monica,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Okay, fine, $300.",8.8
S05E05,monica,300 dollars?!,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!",8.8
S05E05,monica,Urghh!!,8.8
S05E05,joey,What are you guys woofing about?,8.8
S05E05,monica,Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!,8.8
S05E05,joey,"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",8.8
S05E05,ross,You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.,8.8
S05E05,joey,You want my advice?,8.8
S05E05,ross,Yes! Please!,8.8
S05E05,joey,You're not gonna like it.,8.8
S05E05,ross,That's okay.,8.8
S05E05,joey,You got married to fast.,8.8
S05E05,ross,That's not advice!,8.8
S05E05,joey,I told ya.,8.8
S05E05,ross,I'm going to the bathroom.,8.8
S05E05,joey,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",8.8
S05E05,monica,Maybe I could do it.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,Hi!,8.8

S05E05,phoebe,Hey.,8.8
S05E05,monica,Hey.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",8.8
S05E05,joey,"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,That's not Ross!,8.8
S05E05,phoebe,Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",8.8
S05E05,joey,"Hey, you're not Kip!",8.8
S05E05,rachel,Do you even know who Kip is?,8.8
S05E05,joey,Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",8.8
S05E05,joey,"Oh, that poor bastard.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",8.8
S05E05,monica,You're not gonna be phased out!,8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.  He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",8.8
S05E05,phoebe,Ehh!!,8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",8.8

S05E05,chandler,Yes that was mine.,8.8
S05E05,joey,'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,8.8
S05E05,chandler,Yes that would have made more sense.,8.8
S05E05,joey,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",8.8
S05E05,rachel,Phoebe?  You gotta come with me!,8.8
S05E05,phoebe,Come where?,8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.",8.8
S05E05,phoebe,"Okay, but try and get Joey too.",8.8
S05E05,ross,"Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?",8.8
S05E05,phoebe,"Oh, sure!  Forever.",8.8
S05E05,ross,Hi.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,8.8
S05E05,ross,"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Oh, Ross…",8.8
S05E05,ross,"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",8.8
S05E05,ross,"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?",8.8
S05E05,rachel,"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",8.8
S05E05,ross,I can't believe this is happening.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,I know.,8.8
S05E05,ross,I am so sorry.,8.8
S05E05,rachel,I know that too.,8.8

S05E05,chandler,"So, I guess this is over.",8.8
S05E05,monica,What?,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Why, exactly?",8.8
S05E05,chandler,"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",8.8
S05E05,monica,Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!,8.8
S05E05,chandler,"So, this isn't over?",8.8

S05E05,joey,IN LONDON!!!,8.8
S05E05,chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,8.8
S05E05,joey,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,8.8
S05E05,chandler,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,8.8
S05E05,monica,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",8.8
S05E05,joey,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…",8.8
S05E05,monica,"I know, it's great!",8.8
S05E05,joey,"Aww, I don't want to see that!",8.8
S05E05,phoebe,We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,8.8
S05E05,phoebe,"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, \Hi",8.8
S05E05,monica,"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",8.8
S05E05,phoebe,Count for what?,8.8
S05E05,monica,Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.,8.8
S05E05,joey,I guess I'm done.,8.8
S05E05,chandler,Fun's over!,8.8
S05E05,monica,"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",8.8
S05E05,rachel,Uh-huh!,8.8
S05E05,joey,I think I'm gonna take-off.,8.8
S05E05,monica,"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!",8.8
S05E06,joey,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!",8.1
S05E06,monica,What?!,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",8.1
S05E06,chandler,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",8.1
S05E06,monica,Sorry.,8.1
S05E06,chandler,Sorry.,8.1
S05E06,joey,I can hear that!,8.1
S05E06,monica,Rachel's at work.,8.1
S05E06,joey,I can still hear you!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Hey!,8.1
S05E06,joey,Hey!,8.1
S05E06,chandler,Hello!,8.1
S05E06,monica,"Hey, what's that?",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Eeeee-,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!",8.1
S05E06,ross,Hey!,8.1
S05E06,ross,How come? Everybody else does.,8.1
S05E06,monica,What is that?,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",8.1
S05E06,monica,This is all of your things.,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",8.1
S05E06,monica,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",8.1
S05E06,ross,Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",8.1
S05E06,ross,"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",8.1
S05E06,ross,After what I did? Can you blame her?,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",8.1
S05E06,joey,"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",8.1
S05E06,monica,Now calm down Joey.,8.1
S05E06,joey,"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…",8.1
S05E06,monica,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",8.1
S05E06,joey,"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",8.1
S05E06,monica,"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,I want the little round waffles.,8.1
S05E06,monica,"All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,Arghhhh!!!!!!,8.1
S05E06,monica,Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,8.1
S05E06,joey,I'll take it!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,That might work!,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?",8.1
S05E06,chandler,You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.,8.1
S05E06,ross,NA,8.1
S05E06,joey,What's the matter Ross?,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Why?,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",8.1
S05E06,joey,That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,8.1
S05E06,chandler,So you're really okay with this?,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",8.1
S05E06,joey,"Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,You guys! You guys!,8.1
S05E06,monica,"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",8.1
S05E06,monica,"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!",8.1
S05E06,joey,"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",8.1
S05E06,rachel,Yeah!,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Yeah, you fogged Danny.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.",8.1
S05E06,monica,"Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.",8.1
S05E06,monica,We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.,8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",8.1
S05E06,monica,Yeah.,8.1
S05E06,monica,Wow! That guy is so rude!,8.1
S05E06,rachel,Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.,8.1
S05E06,monica,Well you did a little bit.,8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",8.1
S05E06,monica,I totally forgive you!,8.1
S05E06,rachel,Really?,8.1
S05E06,monica,Yes!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Hey!,8.1
S05E06,monica,Hey!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?",8.1
S05E06,monica,Crematorium Chris? Sure!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",8.1
S05E06,monica,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,This is fashion?!  'Cause I do.,8.1
S05E06,ross,NA,8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?",8.1
S05E06,ross,"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"So, rocks.",8.1
S05E06,ross,"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.",8.1
S05E06,joey,"Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?",8.1
S05E06,ross,"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.",8.1
S05E06,joey,"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",8.1
S05E06,ross,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…",8.1
S05E06,joey,"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",8.1
S05E06,ross,Why?,8.1
S05E06,joey,"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",8.1
S05E06,ross,What's going on?,8.1
S05E06,joey,We all hate Emily!,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Nooo!!,8.1
S05E06,monica,"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",8.1
S05E06,joey,Yeah!,8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",8.1
S05E06,joey,Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,8.1
S05E06,monica,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Oh, I know.",8.1
S05E06,joey,I kinda feel like it's my fault.,8.1
S05E06,chandler,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,Hi!,8.1
S05E06,rachel,What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,What?,8.1
S05E06,rachel,What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,8.1
S05E06,rachel,"So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,And stop saying that! I hate that!,8.1
S05E06,rachel,Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,8.1
S05E06,rachel,What?!,8.1
S05E06,rachel,Okay. Okay.,8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Uh, Ross?",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Are you still mad at us?,8.1
S05E06,ross,Yep.,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Oh good! Because we have an \I'm sorry\"" song.""",8.1
S05E06,ross,Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",8.1
S05E06,chandler,"Yeah, we are so sorry.",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,NA,8.1
S05E06,joey,"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",8.1
S05E06,monica,"Whatever you decide, whatever you do.",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!",8.1
S05E06,ross,"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.",8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Yes! Exactly! And that's why…,8.1
S05E06,monica,Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.,8.1
S05E06,ross,Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!",8.1
S05E06,joey,"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.",8.1
S05E06,ross,"You do, huh?",8.1
S05E06,joey,"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…",8.1
S05E06,ross,What are you talking about?,8.1
S05E06,joey,I'm not sure.,8.1
S05E06,rachel,Hi!,8.1
S05E06,monica,"Hey, look at you! Where have you been?",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.",8.1
S05E06,monica,How did that happen?,8.1
S05E06,rachel,That yeti is one smooth talker.,8.1
S05E06,monica,"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.",8.1
S05E06,ross,Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.,8.1
S05E06,rachel,"Ross, I…",8.1

S05E06,rachel,"Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.",8.1

S05E06,phoebe,"Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!",8.1
S05E06,monica,"Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.",8.1
S05E06,joey,It's almost as if he knew.,8.1
S05E06,monica,I'll get it.,8.1
S05E06,ross,Hey!  Hold on.,8.1
S05E06,phoebe,Hi Emily!,8.1

S05E06,ross,Hi.,8.1
S05E06,ross,"Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?",8.1
S05E06,ross,"Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.",8.1
S05E06,ross,"Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.",8.1
S05E06,ross,"So, can you trust me?",8.1
S05E06,joey,I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.,8.1
S05E06,monica,How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!,8.1

S05E07,chandler,Are you looking at naked tribe's women?,8.4
S05E07,joey,"No, look.",8.4

S05E07,joey,"I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.",8.4
S05E07,chandler,Hey!,8.4
S05E07,ross,Emily's cousin kicked me out!,8.4
S05E07,chandler,What?!,8.4
S05E07,joey,Why?,8.4
S05E07,ross,"Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.",8.4
S05E07,chandler,How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?,8.4
S05E07,ross,Who needs a lease when it's family!,8.4
S05E07,joey,"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!",8.4
S05E07,chandler,"Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!",8.4
S05E07,joey,Yeah.,8.4
S05E07,ross,You got it.,8.4
S05E07,joey,Okay.,8.4

S05E07,monica,"Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.",8.4
S05E07,monica,"It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.",8.4
S05E07,phoebe,"Hey, you should really read that book you wrote.  Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!",8.4
S05E07,phoebe,"Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.",8.4
S05E07,phoebe,"Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.",8.4

S05E07,rachel,"Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.",8.4
S05E07,monica,"Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.",8.4
S05E07,monica,Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?,8.4
S05E07,rachel,"I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.",8.4
S05E07,rachel,Hi Danny!  Wow! Thirsty huh?,8.4
S05E07,monica,"Ohh, fun!",8.4
S05E07,rachel,"Ohh, great!",8.4
S05E07,rachel,Yeah.,8.4
S05E07,monica,"Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.",8.4
S05E07,rachel,"Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.",8.4
S05E07,monica,And you're not gonna do that.,8.4
S05E07,rachel,"That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?",8.4
S05E07,monica,So-so there is no party.,8.4
S05E07,rachel,"No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?",8.4
S05E07,monica,"I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.",8.4
S05E07,rachel,Exactly.,8.4

S05E08,joey,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?",9.2
S05E08,chandler,Are you aware that you're still talking?,9.2
S05E08,monica,Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?,9.2

S05E08,phoebe,"Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.",9.2
S05E08,ross,I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.,9.2

S05E08,rachel,"Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?",9.2
S05E08,ross,"Oh God, no.",9.2
S05E08,joey,"Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!",9.2
S05E08,chandler,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",9.2
S05E08,ross,You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.,9.2
S05E08,phoebe,I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.,9.2

S05E08,monica,"Well, get it off now!",9.2
S05E08,joey,I can't! It-it's stuck!,9.2
S05E08,monica,"Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!",9.2
S05E08,phoebe,"All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.",9.2
S05E08,monica,"Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.  Joey? Now is not the time!",9.2

S05E08,joey,I scared you!,9.2
S05E08,chandler,You did look like an idiot.,9.2
S05E08,joey,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, \Butternut squash?\"" And it came out",9.2

S05E08,monica,That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,9.2
S05E08,phoebe,Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?,9.2
S05E08,monica,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",9.2
S05E08,chandler,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.",9.2
S05E08,monica,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!",9.2
S05E08,monica,I'll get it!  Happy Thanksgiving!,9.2

S05E08,monica,"Well, I do.",9.2

S05E08,phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.",9.2
S05E08,ross,I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.,9.2

S05E08,monica,"What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!",9.2
S05E08,rachel,"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.",9.2
S05E08,monica,Yeah.,9.2
S05E08,rachel,Yeah.,9.2
S05E08,monica,And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!,9.2
S05E08,rachel,"Then, you will definitely get him back!",9.2
S05E08,monica,"Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?",9.2
S05E08,rachel,"Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.",9.2
S05E08,monica,What do you mean?,9.2
S05E08,rachel,"Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.",9.2
S05E08,monica,I can do that!,9.2
S05E08,rachel,"Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.",9.2
S05E08,chandler,"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.",9.2

S05E08,chandler,That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!,9.2
S05E08,monica,I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.,9.2
S05E08,chandler,That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!,9.2
S05E08,monica,I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!,9.2
S05E08,chandler,"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.",9.2

S05E08,chandler,You are so great! I love you!,9.2
S05E08,monica,What?,9.2
S05E08,chandler,"Nothing! I said, I said \You're so great\"" and then I just",9.2
S05E08,monica,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!,9.2
S05E08,chandler,No I didn't!,9.2

S05E09,chandler,"Well, yeah actually.",9.1
S05E09,monica,"We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.",9.1
S05E09,chandler,"I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.",9.1
S05E09,monica,We are! Help us!,9.1
S05E09,chandler,Help!,9.1

S05E09,chandler,"Ross, it's just a sandwich!",9.1
S05E09,ross,"Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!",9.1
S05E09,monica,"Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but",9.1
S05E09,ross,"That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.",9.1
S05E09,chandler,"Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?",9.1
S05E09,joey,I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.",9.1
S05E09,ross,"Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, \Keep your mitts off my grub?\""",9.1
S05E09,chandler,"Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.",9.1
S05E09,monica,"Phoebe, you are a bad ass!",9.1

S05E09,phoebe,"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,You completely stole my answer!,9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,Would you care to venture one?,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,Are you just repeating what I'm saying?,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,Okay then.,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!,9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!",9.1
S05E09,ross,Phoebe!,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,Yeah?,9.1
S05E09,ross,"Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.",9.1
S05E09,monica,"Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.",9.1
S05E09,ross,"That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!",9.1

S05E09,monica,We're so sorry.,9.1
S05E09,chandler,Yeah.,9.1
S05E09,joey,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",9.1
S05E09,chandler,"No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.",9.1
S05E09,joey,"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?",9.1
S05E09,chandler,Oh—I don't know.,9.1
S05E09,joey,"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",9.1
S05E09,monica,"Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.",9.1

S05E09,ross,"Yeah, of course, Donald.",9.1
S05E09,ross,What?!,9.1
S05E09,ross,Yeah.,9.1
S05E09,ross,"Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.",9.1
S05E09,ross,"Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…",9.1
S05E09,ross,What?,9.1
S05E09,ross,You ate my sandwich?,9.1
S05E09,ross,Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?,9.1
S05E09,ross,Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?,9.1
S05E09,ross,That said it was my sandwich?!,9.1

S05E09,rachel,"Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,What?,9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,No! You should've read it yourself!,9.1
S05E09,rachel,Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.",9.1
S05E09,chandler,Hey.,9.1
S05E09,monica,"Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.",9.1

S05E09,monica,Why?!,9.1
S05E09,ross,On account of my rage.,9.1
S05E09,chandler,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control.",9.1
S05E09,ross,He gave me a pill for it.,9.1
S05E09,monica,A pill?,9.1
S05E09,ross,"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.",9.1
S05E09,monica,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",9.1
S05E09,chandler,And you're okay with that?,9.1
S05E09,ross,"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.,9.1
S05E09,rachel,That was not funny!,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?",9.1

S05E09,ross,NA,9.1
S05E09,monica,Give me that!,9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!",9.1
S05E09,joey,No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… Kinda…,9.1
S05E09,chandler,"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.",9.1
S05E09,joey,Thank you!,9.1
S05E09,chandler,Joey's a sex addict.,9.1
S05E09,joey,What?!!  No I'm not!!,9.1
S05E09,monica,It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!,9.1
S05E09,joey,No! No! I am not a sex addict!,9.1
S05E09,monica,Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!,9.1
S05E09,joey,"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!",9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Well, what is the truth?",9.1
S05E09,ross,"Yeah, what's going on?",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,What's going on?,9.1
S05E09,joey,I slept with Monica.,9.1
S05E09,chandler,Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?,9.1
S05E09,monica,Oh no!,9.1
S05E09,ross,You slept with my sister?,9.1
S05E09,joey,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.",9.1
S05E09,ross,This is not good for my rage.,9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Monica, is this true?",9.1
S05E09,joey,Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?,9.1
S05E09,monica,Yes it's true.,9.1
S05E09,rachel,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?",9.1
S05E09,joey,Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?,9.1
S05E09,monica,I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.,9.1
S05E09,ross,My God Monica!!,9.1
S05E09,chandler,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?,9.1
S05E09,joey,"No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.,9.1
S05E09,joey,That makes sense!,9.1
S05E09,rachel,And the video camera?,9.1
S05E09,joey,"Uhh, Monica?",9.1
S05E09,monica,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,9.1
S05E09,joey,But sadly I could not be enticed.,9.1
S05E09,ross,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!,9.1
S05E09,monica,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.,9.1
S05E09,joey,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.",9.1
S05E09,phoebe,I don't know! I didn't come with her!,9.1

S05E10,joey,That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,8.2
S05E10,ross,"I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?",8.2
S05E10,joey,"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",8.2
S05E10,joey,"Wait a second, I could star in it!",8.2
S05E10,ross,Or that.,8.2
S05E10,joey,"I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.",8.2
S05E10,ross,"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",8.2

S05E10,joey,Done!,8.2
S05E10,ross,And it can't be Joey.,8.2
S05E10,joey,It's not.,8.2

S05E10,monica,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",8.2
S05E10,monica,You had no relationship!!,8.2
S05E10,rachel,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",8.2
S05E10,monica,"Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.",8.2
S05E10,monica,"Come on, hurry!",8.2
S05E10,joey,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",8.2

S05E10,joey,Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.,8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",8.2
S05E10,joey,You're driving me crazy with that!,8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Okay, I'll stop.",8.2
S05E10,joey,Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,You wanna play?,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",8.2
S05E10,joey,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",8.2
S05E10,chandler,I'm intrigued.,8.2
S05E10,joey,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",8.2
S05E10,joey,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Uh yeah, right here.",8.2

S05E10,chandler,NA,8.2
S05E10,ross,This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!,8.2
S05E10,joey,"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.",8.2
S05E10,ross,Now come on!,8.2
S05E10,joey,Hey!,8.2

S05E10,monica,No.,8.2
S05E10,phoebe,Does it look like an ashtray?,8.2
S05E10,monica,No.,8.2
S05E10,phoebe,Does it look like a urinal?,8.2

S05E10,phoebe,"Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!",8.2
S05E10,monica,"Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.",8.2
S05E10,phoebe,"Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,Hey!,8.2
S05E10,monica,Hey!,8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?",8.2
S05E10,ross,"Oh-oh, yeah.",8.2
S05E10,monica,"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.",8.2
S05E10,ross,"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.",8.2
S05E10,monica,"Still, I was quick as a cat.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.",8.2
S05E10,monica,"Oh, you're kidding.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?",8.2
S05E10,monica,"We don't, we don't wrestle now.",8.2
S05E10,ross,"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.",8.2
S05E10,monica,Too strong for me?,8.2

S05E10,joey,I didn't finish my five pages.,8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?",8.2
S05E10,ross,Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.,8.2
S05E10,joey,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.",8.2
S05E10,ross,"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.",8.2
S05E10,joey,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",8.2
S05E10,ross,I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Come on look guys, don't fight.",8.2
S05E10,ross,"And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",8.2
S05E10,ross,If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",8.2
S05E10,ross,"How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!",8.2

S05E10,ross,"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",8.2
S05E10,chandler,Oh yeah!,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,When did that happen to you?!,8.2
S05E10,joey,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!,8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Oh, great!",8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!",8.2
S05E10,monica,That was unbelievable!,8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Okay, see? I told you!",8.2
S05E10,joey,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,I don't believe they're brother and sister.,8.2

S05E10,phoebe,What?!,8.2
S05E10,phoebe,That chick can't handle my corner.,8.2
S05E10,phoebe,Fine.,8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"No-no, they're not very nice people.",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…",8.2
S05E10,rachel,"Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",8.2
S05E10,ross,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",8.2
S05E10,joey,Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!,8.2
S05E10,ross,Yay!,8.2
S05E10,chandler,"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!",8.2
S05E10,joey,"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!",8.2
S05E10,ross,"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?",8.2
S05E10,chandler,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!,8.2
S05E10,joey,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",8.2
S05E10,chandler,All right.,8.2

S05E10,chandler,"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.",8.2
S05E10,ross,"Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.",8.2
S05E10,chandler,Could I be more sorry.,8.2
S05E10,ross,"I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  I'm sorry.",8.2

S05E11,phoebe,"Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.",9.1
S05E11,monica,She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.,9.1

S05E11,rachel,I don't gossip!,9.1
S05E11,rachel,"Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?",9.1

S05E12,ross,Oh…,8.3
S05E12,ross,This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…,8.3
S05E12,ross,Okay. Sometimes I feel…,8.3

S05E12,chandler,Why would I be mad?,8.3
S05E12,ross,"Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.",8.3
S05E12,chandler,"I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.",8.3
S05E12,ross,Okay.,8.3
S05E12,chandler,I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!,8.3
S05E12,ross,All right.,8.3
S05E12,chandler,"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!",8.3
S05E13,monica,I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!,8.1
S05E13,chandler,"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!",8.1

S05E13,ross,Hey.,8.1
S05E13,joey,"Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!",8.1
S05E13,ross,Sorry.,8.1

S05E13,ross,This would be the place where you explain the hat.,8.1
S05E13,joey,"Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.",8.1

S05E13,joey,"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.",8.1

S05E13,monica,"Well, at least you scared someone.",8.1
S05E13,phoebe,"Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.",8.1

S05E14,rachel,Y'know what you should do?,9.7
S05E14,ross,Huh?,9.7
S05E14,rachel,"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",9.7
S05E14,joey,I'm listening.,9.7
S05E14,rachel,See?,9.7
S05E14,ross,"That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.",9.7

S05E15,ross,Oh that's nice.,8.5
S05E15,ross,Oh. Uhh…,8.5
S05E15,ross,"No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Yes but too me he's just, man.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Ugh, can you believe that guy!",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,Yeah. I really like his glasses.,8.5
S05E15,ross,"…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,Sounds like a fun party.,8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",8.5
S05E15,ross,It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!,8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.",8.5
S05E15,rachel,And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,Wh-wh-why?!,8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",8.5
S05E15,rachel,"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",8.5
S05E15,rachel,Not unless different means the same.,8.5
S05E15,joey,"Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",8.5
S05E15,monica,Isn't this great?,8.5
S05E15,chandler,Hmm.,8.5
S05E15,monica,Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.",8.5
S05E15,monica,Are you okay?,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",8.5
S05E15,monica,What-what are you doing?,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",8.5
S05E15,chandler,What?!,8.5
S05E15,monica,Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",8.5
S05E15,monica,Oh and you know what I want!,8.5
S05E15,chandler,Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,8.5
S05E15,monica,I do not have baby fever!,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",8.5
S05E15,chandler,Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!,8.5
S05E15,monica,You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Well, I did not know that.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,By me?,8.5
S05E15,ross,"Oh, no!",8.5
S05E15,joey,No-no.,8.5
S05E15,ross,"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Yeah, big!",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?",8.5
S05E15,chandler,Monica.,8.5
S05E15,monica,I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,8.5
S05E15,chandler,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,8.5
S05E15,monica,What?!,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.",8.5
S05E15,ross,Phoebe!,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Oh, hi Ross!",8.5
S05E15,ross,What are you doing?,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!",8.5
S05E15,ross,You chipped in?!,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",8.5
S05E15,ross,Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,Hey!,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Yeah, okay, my bad.",8.5
S05E15,joey,Hey!,8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?",8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",8.5
S05E15,joey,Hey! Hiya!,8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",8.5
S05E15,rachel,Oh! Ow!,8.5
S05E15,rachel,Whoa!,8.5

S05E15,joey,Huh.,8.5
S05E15,joey,Uhh….,8.5
S05E15,joey,Nah.,8.5
S05E15,ross,Phoebe?,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,NA,8.5
S05E15,ross,Phoebe? Phoebe?,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,Ooh.,8.5
S05E15,ross,"Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?",8.5
S05E15,ross,"So uh, what did you tell them about me?",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.",8.5
S05E15,ross,Ohh.,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,8.5
S05E15,ross,What?!,8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Ohh, this cake is really good!",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,8.5
S05E15,monica,I'm Monica.,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",8.5
S05E15,monica,Okay.,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.",8.5
S05E15,monica,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,8.5
S05E15,chandler,Monica…,8.5
S05E15,monica,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",8.5
S05E15,chandler,Will you marry me?,8.5
S05E15,ross,Oh-no. No. No.,8.5
S05E15,joey,What a bad idea!,8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Chandler, why are you doing this?",8.5
S05E15,chandler,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,8.5
S05E15,monica,Chandler.,8.5
S05E15,chandler,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,8.5
S05E15,monica,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",8.5
S05E15,monica,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.",8.5
S05E15,monica,Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,8.5
S05E15,ross,Hey!,8.5
S05E15,joey,She's right y'know.,8.5
S05E15,ross,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",8.5
S05E15,chandler,I didn't think I was!,8.5
S05E15,monica,"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",8.5
S05E15,ross,"No, I will not!",8.5
S05E15,joey,"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",8.5
S05E15,phoebe,"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",8.5
S05E15,rachel,"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",8.5
S05E15,chandler,"Okay, how long is this going to go on.",8.5
S05E15,monica,"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",8.5
S05E15,ross,"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole \We were on a break thing?\"" Well",8.5
S05E15,chandler,That's not funny.,8.5
S05E15,joey,That's not funny at all!,8.5
S05E16,joey,Hey!,8.5
S05E16,chandler,Hey!,8.5
S05E16,monica,Hey!,8.5
S05E16,joey,What are you guys doing up?,8.5
S05E16,chandler,"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",8.5
S05E16,joey,Dark red.,8.5
S05E16,chandler,"Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?",8.5
S05E16,monica,NA,8.5
S05E16,joey,"Aww, you guys are so cute!",8.5
S05E16,monica,I know.,8.5
S05E16,joey,"All right, I'll see you in the morning.",8.5
S05E16,rachel,"Uhh, we still need a tip.",8.5
S05E16,phoebe,All right. Hold on.  How much more do we need?,8.5
S05E16,rachel,A couple of bucks.,8.5
S05E16,phoebe,"Okay, dime!  Oh my God, this is a police badge!",8.6
S05E16,monica,Wow!,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",8.6
S05E16,phoebe,"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!",8.6
S05E16,joey,"Hey, you guys!",8.6
S05E16,chandler,Hey!,8.6
S05E16,rachel,Hey Joey!,8.6
S05E16,monica,Hey.,8.6
S05E16,joey,"Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?",8.6
S05E16,monica,"Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?",8.6
S05E16,joey,"Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.",8.6
S05E16,monica,"I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",8.6
S05E16,joey,No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!,8.6
S05E16,monica,Are you saying I smell bad?,8.6
S05E16,joey,"No! No, you smell like a meadow.",8.6
S05E16,monica,What's with him?,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Ugh!,8.6
S05E16,ross,"\Come here to me!\""",8.6
S05E16,rachel,What?! You say that to kids?!!,8.6
S05E16,ross,"No! No! No! The \Come here to me\"" is y'know for the ladies.""",8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",8.6
S05E16,ross,Yeah?,8.6
S05E16,ross,"Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!",8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!",8.6
S05E16,ross,"Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Yeah!  Are you kiddin'?,8.6
S05E16,ross,"Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Oh. Oh! I can do it!,8.6
S05E16,ross,Yeah!,8.6
S05E16,ross,"Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Ross!,8.6
S05E16,ross,What's that supposed to mean?,8.6
S05E16,rachel,Ross!,8.6
S05E16,ross,"Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.",8.6
S05E16,ross,Yeah! Rach?,8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.",8.6
S05E16,ross,Then tell him quickly.,8.6
S05E16,rachel,We went out.,8.6
S05E16,ross,"Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!,8.6
S05E16,ross,A loser you did it with  298 times!,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,"Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?",8.6
S05E16,phoebe,You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,"Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.",8.6
S05E16,phoebe,You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.  Backup! Backup!!,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!",8.6
S05E16,ross,Okay.,8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",8.6
S05E16,ross,"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",8.6
S05E16,ross,"Okay, go left. Left! Left!",8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",8.6
S05E16,ross,"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Yeah.,8.6

S05E16,ross,"Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Any chance you think the couch looks good there?,8.6
S05E16,phoebe,…so this guy was all  It was just so cool!,8.6
S05E16,monica,"Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!",8.6
S05E16,phoebe,I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",8.6
S05E16,phoebe,"You could get arrested, right now!",8.6
S05E16,phoebe,Hey.,8.6
S05E16,joey,Oh.,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Hi, Joe.",8.6
S05E16,joey,"Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.",8.6
S05E16,monica,"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.",8.6
S05E16,joey,What?! Why?!,8.6
S05E16,monica,What is going on with you?,8.6
S05E16,joey,Nothing!,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",8.6
S05E16,joey,"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,",8.6
S05E16,chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.,8.6
S05E16,joey,"Well, it involved Monica.",8.6
S05E16,chandler,"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!",8.6
S05E16,joey,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.",8.6
S05E16,monica,What was the dream about?,8.6
S05E16,joey,"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",8.6
S05E16,monica,"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!",8.6
S05E16,joey,It-it doesn’t?,8.6
S05E16,monica,No!,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",8.6
S05E16,joey,That kinda sounds like your dream dude.,8.6
S05E16,monica,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",8.6
S05E16,joey,In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.,8.6
S05E16,monica,Um-hmm.,8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",8.6
S05E16,joey,Not really.,8.6
S05E16,chandler,Well there you have it!,8.6
S05E16,monica,"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",8.6
S05E16,joey,"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",8.6
S05E16,joey,Friends first? That's interesting.,8.6
S05E16,monica,You become friends after?,8.6
S05E16,joey,"No, never done that either.",8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",8.6
S05E16,chandler,"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.",8.6
S05E16,monica,That's right.,8.6
S05E16,rachel,What's up Joey?,8.6

S05E16,joey,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…",8.6
S05E16,rachel,Yeah?,8.6

S05E16,joey,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,8.6

S05E16,joey,I'll treat you real nice.,8.6
S05E16,rachel,"Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",8.6
S05E16,joey,Won't-won't that take longer?,8.6

S05E16,chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.",8.6

S05E17,monica,"Come on, we can't let them win!",8.5
S05E17,chandler,"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!",8.5
S05E17,monica,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!,8.5

S05E17,monica,Really?,8.5
S05E17,chandler,"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.",8.5
S05E17,monica,"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.",8.5

S05E18,joey,"All right now, memorize it.  You got it?",8
S05E18,chandler,Oh yes.,8
S05E18,joey,NA,8
S05E18,chandler,Yes.,8
S05E18,ross,Hi!,8
S05E18,chandler,Hi there!,8
S05E18,phoebe,What are you talking about?!,8
S05E18,ross,"Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.",8
S05E18,joey,Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.,8
S05E18,ross,"I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…",8
S05E18,joey,I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!,8
S05E18,chandler,That.,8
S05E18,rachel,"Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!",8
S05E18,joey,Luck!,8
S05E18,chandler,"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?",8
S05E18,rachel,"Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…",8
S05E18,chandler,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.",8
S05E18,monica,"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.",8
S05E18,rachel,"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!",8
S05E18,phoebe,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.",8
S05E18,joey,"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.",8
S05E18,phoebe,"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.",8
S05E18,monica,"I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",8
S05E18,joey,Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!,8
S05E18,ross,Okay!!,8
S05E18,joey,Done.,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",8
S05E18,monica,I would love to do it together!,8
S05E18,joey,They're gonna do it together.,8
S05E18,chandler,Dude! That's my girlfriend!,8
S05E18,joey,"What, so I gotta shut it down now?",8
S05E18,ross,"All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.",8
S05E18,monica,It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.,8
S05E18,ross,Yeah.,8
S05E18,chandler,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?,8
S05E18,joey,Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?,8
S05E18,ross,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.,8
S05E18,joey,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.",8
S05E18,ross,You're not his godfather.,8
S05E18,joey,What?! Are you kidding?!,8
S05E18,ross,"Okay, let's go godfather.",8
S05E18,joey,All right!,8
S05E18,joey,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!",8
S05E18,ross,Really? That's great!,8
S05E18,joey,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…",8
S05E18,joey,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",8
S05E18,ross,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,",8
S05E18,joey,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",8
S05E18,ross,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",8
S05E18,joey,I look more like him than you do!,8
S05E18,rachel,"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.",8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh, what a fun office.",8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",8
S05E18,rachel,…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!,8
S05E18,monica,That doesn't seem fair.,8
S05E18,rachel,"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",8
S05E18,chandler,"Yeah, it is the best.",8
S05E18,rachel,"I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",8
S05E18,monica,"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.",8
S05E18,rachel,"Yeah, I can do that.",8
S05E18,chandler,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.",8
S05E18,phoebe,Hey!,8
S05E18,monica,Hey!,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?",8
S05E18,rachel,I would love to!,8
S05E18,phoebe,Oh good!,8
S05E18,chandler,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe.",8
S05E18,phoebe,Oh good.,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Oh wait, I change my mind!",8
S05E18,monica,"Yeah, me too!",8
S05E18,phoebe,"Oh, look at that.",8
S05E18,monica,"All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.",8
S05E18,phoebe,What happened to the intimate dinner party?,8
S05E18,monica,"Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…",8
S05E18,phoebe,"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.",8
S05E18,monica,"What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!",8
S05E18,phoebe,Like what?,8
S05E18,monica,Cups.,8
S05E18,phoebe,Cups? You're giving me cups?,8
S05E18,monica,And ice!,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?  All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!",8
S05E18,monica,"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…",8
S05E18,phoebe,I got it! Mine!,8
S05E18,ross,Hi.,8
S05E18,monica,Hey! How'd the audition go?!,8
S05E18,ross,Not so good.,8
S05E18,monica,"Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's  Yeah it did?\"",8
S05E18""",8
S05E18,joey,"Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.",8
S05E18,monica,You got a callback too didn't you?,8
S05E18,joey,Yeah I did!,8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.",8
S05E18,rachel,Oh great!,8
S05E18,rachel,Oh that's okay.,8
S05E18,rachel,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, \Wow",8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh, me too.",8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh, me too.",8
S05E18,ross,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?",8
S05E18,joey,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…",8
S05E18,joey,Who knows?,8
S05E18,ross,Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!,8
S05E18,joey,Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!,8
S05E18,ross,Yeah!,8
S05E18,joey,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",8
S05E18,ross,"Yeah, it is.",8
S05E18,ross,"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.",8
S05E18,phoebe,Hey!,8
S05E18,phoebe,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?,8
S05E18,chandler,Ah sure. What's in 'em?,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Umm, cups.",8
S05E18,chandler,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.",8
S05E18,ross,Seriously that's a lot of cups.,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",8
S05E18,chandler,Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.,8
S05E18,phoebe,"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!",8
S05E18,joey,Hey Pheebs!  Hey!,8
S05E18,ross,Hey!,8
S05E18,joey,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.",8
S05E18,ross,What's up?,8
S05E18,joey,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.",8
S05E18,ross,"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.",8
S05E18,joey,That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!,8
S05E18,ross,"Well, you just…",8
S05E18,joey,"I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!",8
S05E18,ross,What?!,8
S05E18,joey,What? Chandler! Tell 'em!,8
S05E18,chandler,NA,8
S05E18,ross,"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.",8
S05E18,joey,At least I care about his feelings!,8
S05E18,ross,What?!,8
S05E18,joey,Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?,8
S05E18,ross,And why wouldn't he get it?,8
S05E18,joey,"Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!",8
S05E18,ross,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?,8
S05E18,joey,You just give him a spoon baby!,8
S05E18,ross,Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!,8
S05E18,joey,Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!,8
S05E18,ross,You're kid's name is Raymond!,8
S05E18,joey,Yeah?! So's yours!,8
S05E18,monica,How did work go?,8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.",8
S05E18,monica,You stink!,8
S05E18,rachel,Thanks!,8
S05E18,monica,"No, I'm-I'm serious!",8
S05E18,rachel,Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.,8
S05E18,chandler,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!",8
S05E18,rachel,I did not!,8
S05E18,chandler,Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!,8
S05E18,rachel,"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",8
S05E18,chandler,I wish I had smoked for my career…,8
S05E18,monica,That's so gross!,8
S05E18,rachel,"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.",8
S05E18,chandler,"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!",8
S05E18,monica,"Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.",8
S05E18,chandler,I think you smell great!,8
S05E18,rachel,I am so on board!,8
S05E18,rachel,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.",8
S05E18,rachel,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!,8
S05E18,rachel,Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!,8
S05E18,rachel,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!,8
S05E18,rachel,Okay then!,8
S05E18,joey,"Hmmm, soup!  Hmm, soup!",8
S05E18,joey,"Oh yeah, no problem.",8
S05E18,joey,"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.",8
S05E18,ross,Joey!,8
S05E18,joey,Ross!,8
S05E18,ross,"I mean, Ben! Ben!",8
S05E18,joey,Hi!,8

S05E18,joey,"Oh, what did I say?",8

S05E18,rachel,Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!,8
S05E18,rachel,"Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?",8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.",8
S05E18,rachel,Okay.,8
S05E18,rachel,Oh man!,8
S05E18,phoebe,NA,8

S05E18,phoebe,Ahhh! Mystical!,8
S05E18,chandler,Awesome!,8

S05E18,rachel,Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.,8
S05E18,phoebe,I was in charge of cups.,8
S05E18,rachel,"Oh, okay, not so weird.",8
S05E18,ross,Hey!,8
S05E18,joey,Hey.,8
S05E18,ross,"Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.",8
S05E18,joey,Yeah right!,8
S05E18,ross,"No really, I-I am! I feel bad!",8
S05E18,joey,"Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, \Hmm",8
S05E18,ross,"Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.",8
S05E18,joey,What you do mean?,8
S05E18,ross,"I think, sub-consciously…",8
S05E18,joey,"Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.",8
S05E18,ross,"I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.",8
S05E18,joey,"Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…",8
S05E18,ross,No!,8
S05E18,joey,"No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.",8
S05E18,ross,There you go. Thank you!,8
S05E18,joey,"Thank you! So, did-did he get it?",8
S05E18,ross,No.,8
S05E18,joey,"Eh, what are you gonna do?",8
S05E18,chandler,"Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.",8
S05E18,chandler,"Okay, great.",8
S05E18,chandler,I'll catch you guys later.,8
S05E19,ross,Hey!,8.7
S05E19,chandler,Hey!,8.7
S05E19,ross,Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?,8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.",8.7
S05E19,ross,Wow! How'd you get in there?,8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.",8.7
S05E19,chandler,Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.,8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.",8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Oh, okay.  Here you go.",8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.",8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Okay, bye!",8.7
S05E19,ross,What the hell was that?!,8.7
S05E19,chandler,What?,8.7
S05E19,ross,"The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!",8.7
S05E19,chandler,I was not flirting.,8.7
S05E19,ross,"It was totally flirting. \Somebody got a haircut \""",8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.",8.7
S05E19,ross,"Yeah, right.",8.7
S05E19,chandler,You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.,8.7
S05E19,ross,I'm good.,8.7
S05E19,rachel,"I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!",8.7
S05E19,phoebe,I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?,8.7
S05E19,rachel,No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.,8.7
S05E19,phoebe,Don't get me started on that.,8.7
S05E19,chandler,I was not flirting.,8.7
S05E19,ross,"And on your anniversary, for shame!",8.7
S05E19,rachel,What's going on?,8.7
S05E19,ross,Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!,8.7
S05E19,chandler,"I was not and oh God, shh!",8.7
S05E19,ross,"Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.",8.7
S05E19,phoebe,Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.,8.7
S05E19,ross,Well…,8.7
S05E19,chandler,Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?,8.7
S05E19,rachel,Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.,8.7
S05E19,ross,"Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.",8.7
S05E19,rachel,Hm-mmm.,8.7
S05E19,ross,And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…,8.7
S05E19,rachel,"Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.",8.7
S05E19,phoebe,"Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!",8.7
S05E19,ross,"This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.",8.7
S05E19,phoebe,See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.,8.7
S05E19,joey,"Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!",8.7
S05E19,rachel,Big night!,8.7

S05E19,chandler,"Happy Anniversary, 10 months!",8.7
S05E19,monica,"So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London…",8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.",8.7
S05E19,monica,Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?,8.7
S05E19,chandler,The one that doesn't.,8.7
S05E19,monica,That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.,8.7
S05E19,chandler,"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?",8.7
S05E19,monica,That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.,8.7
S05E19,chandler,Okay.,8.7
S05E19,monica,You have got to go home!,8.7
S05E19,phoebe,But I like it here!,8.7
S05E19,monica,You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.,8.7

S05E19,phoebe,"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?",8.7
S05E19,rachel,"Oh what, you-you want both of them?",8.7
S05E19,phoebe,"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!",8.7
S05E19,rachel,"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.",8.7
S05E19,phoebe,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!",8.7
S05E19,rachel,Tell her to wear her own earrings.,8.7
S05E19,phoebe,These are her earrings.,8.7
S05E19,rachel,Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!,8.7
S05E19,phoebe,Why not?,8.7
S05E19,rachel,Because I lose her stuff!,8.7
S05E19,joey,"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",8.7
S05E19,joey,"Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.",8.7
S05E19,chandler,"If you said, \Big lima bean",8.7

S05E20,rachel,What?! We can't do that!,8.3
S05E20,monica,"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!,8.3
S05E20,monica,"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,I don't think he's the one who needs help.,8.3
S05E20,monica,"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.  Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Ugh!,8.3
S05E20,monica,"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Noooooooo!,8.3
S05E20,chandler,"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",8.3

S05E20,monica,Oh yeah right!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",8.3
S05E20,monica,There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,Yeah well unless we tell him.,8.3
S05E20,monica,"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",8.3
S05E20,ross,NA,8.3
S05E20,monica,Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,Right?,8.3
S05E20,phoebe,John Glenn is here?!,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…",8.3
S05E20,phoebe,Hi!,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",8.3
S05E20,phoebe,"My God, Joey!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,It was a car backfire!,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",8.3
S05E20,joey,"Yeah, I didn't know that.",8.3
S05E20,ross,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,8.3
S05E20,chandler,Who jumps at loud noises!,8.3
S05E20,ross,Wow! I could've died tonight.,8.3
S05E20,chandler,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.",8.3
S05E20,ross,I do have a newfound respect for life.,8.3
S05E20,chandler,NA,8.3
S05E20,phoebe,"Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",8.3
S05E20,phoebe,Okay!,8.3
S05E20,phoebe,Bye!,8.3
S05E20,joey,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,8.3
S05E20,joey,Dude! How come you took off?,8.3
S05E20,chandler,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…",8.3
S05E20,joey,Is something wrong?,8.3
S05E20,chandler,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",8.3
S05E20,joey,Okay.,8.3
S05E20,chandler,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,8.3
S05E20,joey,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,I do not hate Ross!,8.3
S05E20,joey,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,8.3
S05E20,chandler,What picture?,8.3
S05E20,joey,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",8.3
S05E20,joey,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",8.3
S05E20,joey,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",8.3
S05E20,chandler,From a bullet!,8.3
S05E20,joey,I know it doesn't make much sense…,8.3
S05E20,chandler,Much sense?!,8.3
S05E20,joey,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",8.3
S05E20,joey,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",8.3
S05E20,joey,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,8.3
S05E20,chandler,Really?!,8.3
S05E20,joey,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.",8.3
S05E20,chandler,Thanks.,8.3
S05E20,joey,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",8.3
S05E20,joey,How good is that?,8.3
S05E20,chandler,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",8.3
S05E20,joey,See?,8.3
S05E20,chandler,Hm-hmm.,8.3
S05E20,joey,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",8.3
S05E20,chandler,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,8.3
S05E20,joey,Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,Hey! Hi!,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",8.3
S05E20,ross,The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,What?! What? What happened?!,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Yeah!,8.3
S05E20,ross,And somebody took a shot at me!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,Really?!,8.3
S05E20,ross,"No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Because a car backfired?,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Okay, why are you here?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole \seizing\"" thing but um",8.3
S05E20,ross,You talked to her?,8.3
S05E20,rachel,"No, she left a message.  something wrong with your machine.",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Well, okay, what-what did she say?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",8.3
S05E20,ross,Wow!,8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.  Your decision.",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",8.3
S05E20,ross,"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",8.3
S05E20,ross,Huh.,8.3
S05E20,rachel,"I mean, look-look today you escaped  death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",8.3
S05E20,ross,"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Well, there you go!",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Close call day.,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Hey, thanks Rach.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.",8.3
S05E20,ross,Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.,8.3
S05E20,rachel,Oh?,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,No.,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",8.3
S05E20,rachel,Yeah.,8.3
S05E20,ross,"Yeah, I want my money back.",8.3
S05E20,rachel,"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",8.3
S05E20,ross,"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",8.3
S05E20,phoebe,"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",8.3
S05E20,ross,"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",8.3
S05E20,monica,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",8.3
S05E20,chandler,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,8.3
S05E20,ross,I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,8.3
S05E20,chandler,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",8.3
S05E20,joey,"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",8.3
S05E20,phoebe,Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.  Not you Joey.,8.3
S05E21,phoebe,"I'm fine, thanks.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",8.5
S05E21,monica,No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Okay.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Hiya doin' pumpkin?,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Nope.,8.5
S05E21,monica,"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",8.5
S05E21,monica,Oh my God!,8.5
S05E21,monica,I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?,8.5
S05E21,monica,"I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Okay. Bye!,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"So, what movie should we see?",8.5
S05E21,monica,Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,What?! Really?!,8.5
S05E21,monica,"He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,I can't believe this!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",8.5
S05E21,monica,Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",8.5
S05E21,monica,Ohhhh!,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"So, what are you gonna do?",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Me?! Why me?,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",8.5
S05E21,monica,That is so sweet!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,NA,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",8.5
S05E21,ross,"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.",8.5
S05E21,joey,Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.,8.5
S05E21,ross,Also an island.,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Hey, what time is it?",8.5
S05E21,ross,2:17.,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",8.5
S05E21,ross,Are you serious?!,8.5
S05E21,joey,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,8.5
S05E21,ross,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Hey, you guys…",8.5
S05E21,joey,Hey!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,Is Monica here?,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",8.5
S05E21,ross,You bought Shawn Cassidy!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",8.5
S05E21,rachel,Okay!  Check it out!,8.5
S05E21,ross,What-what is it?!,8.5
S05E21,joey,What the hell is that?!!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"It's a, it's a cat!",8.5
S05E21,joey,"That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",8.5
S05E21,rachel,Yes it is!,8.5
S05E21,ross,Why is it inside out?!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",8.5
S05E21,ross,How much did you pay for that?,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",8.5
S05E21,ross,Yeah? How much?,8.5
S05E21,rachel,A thousand bucks.,8.5
S05E21,ross,ON A CAT??!!!!,8.5
S05E21,joey,It's not a cat!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",8.5
S05E21,ross,"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",8.5
S05E21,joey,It's not a cat!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",8.5
S05E21,ross,"Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?",8.5
S05E21,joey,"Uhh, the ball thing.",8.5
S05E21,ross,Yeah?,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!",8.5
S05E21,ross,"Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",8.5
S05E21,joey,Okay!,8.5
S05E21,joey,Uh-oh.,8.5
S05E21,ross,What?,8.5
S05E21,joey,I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!",8.5
S05E21,ross,"I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?",8.5
S05E21,chandler,Hey ladies! What are you in here for?,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",8.5
S05E21,chandler,You mean scared.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Scared? Happy?,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Were you're parents happy, or something?",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Yeah, you're right about that.",8.5
S05E21,ross,…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!,8.5
S05E21,joey,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.,8.5
S05E21,monica,Hey guys!,8.5
S05E21,joey,Hi!,8.5
S05E21,monica,"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here, where is it?",8.5
S05E21,joey,I don't know.,8.5
S05E21,monica,"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!",8.5
S05E21,ross,How do you know? You don't have a watch.,8.5
S05E21,monica,"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!",8.5
S05E21,joey,"Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.",8.5
S05E21,monica,What?!,8.5
S05E21,ross,"Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!",8.5
S05E21,joey,"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in…",8.5
S05E21,ross,"2 hours, 27 minutes.",8.5
S05E21,monica,Really?!,8.5
S05E21,monica,NA,8.5
S05E21,ross,Hey Rach!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,Hey.,8.5
S05E21,ross,Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.",8.5
S05E21,monica,Rach?,8.5
S05E21,rachel,Yeah?,8.5
S05E21,monica,"You have scratches all over you, what happened?",8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Well, it's my cat.",8.5
S05E21,monica,What?!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Oh yeah, I got a cat.",8.5
S05E21,monica,I don't want a cat!,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.",8.5
S05E21,ross,Yeah.,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, \Rachel!\""",8.5
S05E21,ross,Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,8.5
S05E21,monica,What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Well, I was gonna let you play with it.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,Hi!,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,What?!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"Ohh!! God!  Get out of here, good for nothing.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,Hey Gar!,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Yeah! Okay.,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Thanks! Okay.,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Yeah?,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Uh-hmm.,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.",8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Yeah?,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Which is why my answer is yes!,8.5
S05E21,phoebe,Uh-huh!,8.5
S05E21,ross,Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?,8.5
S05E21,joey,That's right baby.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,"All right, let me in.",8.5
S05E21,monica,No-no! Don't do it! Don't!,8.5
S05E21,chandler,What?,8.5
S05E21,monica,He's a dropper!,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Oh yeah, that's right!",8.5
S05E21,chandler,I'm not a dropper!,8.5
S05E21,ross,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",8.5
S05E21,chandler,It's throwing and catching!,8.5
S05E21,ross,All right.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Oh! Oh! That's so hard.,8.5
S05E21,joey,"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",8.5
S05E21,monica,Oh my—Oh good God!,8.5
S05E21,rachel,"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",8.5
S05E21,ross,"Baking it didn't help, huh?",8.5
S05E21,monica,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",8.5
S05E21,rachel,I tried! They won't take her back.,8.5
S05E21,chandler,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.,8.5
S05E21,monica,"Rach, why won't they take it back?",8.5
S05E21,rachel,"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",8.5
S05E21,monica,"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",8.5
S05E21,rachel,"No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!",8.5
S05E21,monica,"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.",8.5
S05E21,chandler,"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.",8.5

S05E22,chandler,"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?",8.3
S05E22,phoebe,I do!,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S05E22,monica,Not even close.,8.3

S05E22,monica,Put your head back.,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Yes!,8.3
S05E22,monica,All right.,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S05E22,monica,"Now, open your eyes.",8.3
S05E22,rachel,"Okay, they are.",8.3
S05E22,monica,How many fingers am I holding up?,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Four.,8.3
S05E22,monica,"Oh my God, I was thinking four.",8.3
S05E22,rachel,Really?!,8.3
S05E22,monica,"Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?",8.3
S05E22,rachel,Okay!,8.3

S05E22,rachel,"Well, well, you said it was practice!",8.3
S05E22,monica,Then why did you move?!,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Because I knew you were lying!,8.3
S05E22,monica,"All right, come here!",8.3
S05E22,rachel,NA,8.3
S05E22,monica,I am going… I'm going--Turn it over!,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!,8.3
S05E22,rachel,Monica! Stop it!,8.3
S05E22,monica,Damn! It's empty!,8.3
S05E22,rachel,"Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!",8.3
S05E22,phoebe,"Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!",8.3
S05E22,monica,I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.,8.3
S05E22,joey,Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!,8.3
S05E22,monica,What did you do to his sweater vests?,8.3
S05E22,joey,Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.,8.3
S05E22,monica,"Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.",8.3
S05E22,phoebe,"Hey, dude!",8.3
S05E22,joey,"Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?",8.3
S05E22,phoebe,Oh that's my grandma.,8.3
S05E22,chandler,Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,"Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.",8.3
S05E22,chandler,"Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?",8.3
S05E22,monica,"Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.",8.3
S05E22,chandler,That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn…,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!",8.3
S05E22,chandler,Really?,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.,8.3
S05E22,ross,"Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?",8.3
S05E22,phoebe,Uh-hmm.,8.3
S05E22,ross,What do you like better flora or fauna?,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,Fauna.,8.3
S05E22,ross,Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,Garfunkle.,8.3
S05E22,ross,Why are you mad at me?,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,You said I was boring--Ohh!,8.3
S05E22,ross,When did I say you were boring?!,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,"Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!",8.3
S05E22,ross,Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!,8.3
S05E22,phoebe,"Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!  Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.",8.3
S05E22,joey,Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.,8.3
S05E22,joey,Wh-what?! Why?!,8.3

S05E23,joey,That's it! Thanks Pheebs!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,Hey!,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Let me talk to him!,8.8
S05E23,joey,No!  Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Who was that?,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.",8.8
S05E23,joey,"Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Yeah!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,Hey!,8.8
S05E23,joey,Don't come out here!,8.8

S05E23,phoebe,It's okay. What the hell took you so long?,8.8
S05E23,monica,"Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Which Richard?,8.8
S05E23,monica,The Richard.,8.8

S05E23,monica,"Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?",8.8
S05E23,monica,"It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.,8.8
S05E23,monica,Really?,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"But again, Simmons. Go on.",8.8
S05E23,monica,"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?,8.8
S05E23,monica,Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!",8.8
S05E23,monica,I know.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!,8.8
S05E23,monica,What?,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,On a totally different bet.,8.8
S05E23,chandler,Hey!,8.8
S05E23,monica,It's almost our anniversary!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.,8.8

S05E23,monica,Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,Wow!,8.8
S05E23,monica,"For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Do we have to?,8.8
S05E23,monica,No.,8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",8.8
S05E23,monica,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Yeah, I think we should see other people.",8.8
S05E23,monica,"But we can go, right?",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Yes.,8.8
S05E23,monica,Okay!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,It's a great idea.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna go too!",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.",8.8
S05E23,monica,"Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!",8.8
S05E23,rachel,Hi!,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Hey!,8.8
S05E23,ross,Hey!,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!",8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.",8.8
S05E23,ross,"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Art lover!,8.8
S05E23,ross,What'd you say?,8.8
S05E23,chandler,I said art lover.,8.8
S05E23,ross,Is that supposed to be an insult?,8.8
S05E23,chandler,"I don't know, I'm very tired.",8.8
S05E23,ross,"So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.",8.8
S05E23,rachel,That sounds great.,8.8
S05E23,ross,Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.",8.8
S05E23,rachel,No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Naked alone time.,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",8.8
S05E23,chandler,So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Okay, what about after I give you these candies?",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Ah-ha! Okay,",8.8

S05E23,monica,"Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,What-what Richard thing?,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Oh no. [The patented version.],8.8
S05E23,chandler,What Richard thing?,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Simmons! Go with Simmons!,8.8
S05E23,monica,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,I'm not mad.,8.8
S05E23,monica,Really?!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.",8.8

S05E23,rachel,NA,8.8
S05E23,ross,"Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?",8.8
S05E23,rachel,NA,8.8

S05E23,rachel,"Uh, yeah, if you want too.",8.8

S05E23,rachel,"Yeah, sure?",8.8
S05E23,ross,So do I.,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"And um, what-what is that Ross?",8.8
S05E23,ross,The physical act of love.,8.8
S05E23,rachel,What?! Are you crazy?,8.8
S05E23,ross,Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!",8.8
S05E23,ross,You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!",8.8
S05E23,ross,No! No!,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!",8.8

S05E23,rachel,"Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of \us?\""",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"Hey you guys wait! Guys!  This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!",8.8
S05E23,monica,"Phoebe, you don't eat animals.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,"For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Oh! Look! Hi!",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Oh my God.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Hey! Joey!,8.8
S05E23,joey,Hi!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,Love your condoms my man.,8.8
S05E23,joey,What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Why are you dressed as a gladiator?,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.  Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.",8.8
S05E23,monica,Who are you talking too?,8.8
S05E23,joey,"They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Why?! What happened?!,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.",8.8
S05E23,monica,I'm so sorry.,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.",8.8
S05E23,monica,I knew you were not okay with that.,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,So you're a gladiator! Wow!,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Yeah, what-what's going on?",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Monica had lunch with Richard.,8.8
S05E23,joey,Dawson?!,8.8
S05E23,phoebe,Noo! But that would've been so cool!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,No! Her boyfriend Richard!,8.8
S05E23,monica,"It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?",8.8
S05E23,chandler,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!,8.8
S05E23,monica,You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.,8.8
S05E23,chandler,Thanks.,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Aww, there we go.",8.8
S05E23,phoebe,I love Vegas!,8.8
S05E23,monica,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Next time?,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Ooh, so close.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!,8.8
S05E23,monica,"I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"That's so funny, because I think I just did!",8.8
S05E23,monica,"Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Fine with me!,8.8
S05E23,monica,Fine! Happy Anniversary!,8.8
S05E23,joey,Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.,8.8
S05E23,monica,No it is not!,8.8
S05E23,chandler,What are you talking…,8.8
S05E23,joey,Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.",8.8
S05E23,ross,Yep! That's hilarious!,8.8
S05E23,rachel,I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.,8.8
S05E23,ross,"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.",8.8
S05E23,rachel,"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",8.8
S05E23,ross,Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.",8.8
S05E23,ross,What?! You totally get embarrassed!,8.8
S05E23,rachel,"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.",8.8
S05E23,ross,Is that so?,8.8
S05E23,rachel,Yeah.,8.8
S05E23,ross,NA,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Really?,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.",8.8
S05E23,joey,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.",8.8
S05E23,chandler,Whoa!,8.8
S05E23,joey,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!",8.8
S05E23,chandler,"Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!",8.8

S06E01,chandler,"Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",8.7
S06E01,joey,Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.,8.7
S06E01,chandler,What?!,8.7
S06E01,joey,"Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.",8.7

S06E01,monica,"Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.",8.7
S06E01,phoebe,"No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.",8.7
S06E01,ross,Hey!,8.7
S06E01,chandler,Hey!,8.7
S06E01,ross,What?,8.7
S06E01,chandler,Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…,8.7
S06E01,rachel,"What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.",8.7
S06E01,ross,Yeah!,8.7
S06E01,phoebe,Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.,8.7
S06E01,monica,Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!,8.7
S06E01,rachel,NA,8.7

S06E01,ross,What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.,8.7
S06E01,rachel,"No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!",8.7
S06E01,ross,We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.,8.7
S06E01,rachel,Oh my God.,8.7
S06E01,ross,I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!,8.7
S06E01,rachel,No!,8.7
S06E01,joey,They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!,8.7
S06E01,phoebe,"Hell, I’m drunk right now!  What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!",8.7
S06E01,monica,What are you guys gonna do?,8.7
S06E01,rachel,"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?",8.7
S06E01,chandler,"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.",8.7
S06E01,ross,"Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.",8.7
S06E01,joey,An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.,8.7
S06E01,phoebe,"Oh-oh, that’s your thing.",8.7
S06E01,ross,What?,8.7
S06E01,phoebe,You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.,8.7
S06E01,ross,"No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!",8.7
S06E01,phoebe,"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  I’m so drunk.",8.7
S06E01,monica,"So, what do you think we should do?",8.7
S06E01,chandler,I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!,8.7
S06E01,monica,I know I love you!,8.7
S06E01,chandler,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.,8.7
S06E01,monica,"That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",8.7
S06E01,chandler,"Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.",8.7
S06E01,monica,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.",8.7
S06E01,chandler,Sounds great.,8.7
S06E01,monica,Okay.,8.7
S06E01,monica,Ready?,8.7

S06E01,chandler,"Yes, yes eight.",8.7
S06E01,monica,Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.,8.7
S06E01,chandler,"That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.",8.7
S06E01,monica,Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.,8.7
S06E01,chandler,"That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",8.7
S06E01,monica,I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?,8.7
S06E01,chandler,"Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?",8.7

S06E01,joey,What?!,8.7
S06E01,phoebe,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",8.7
S06E01,joey,All right. All right.,8.7

S06E01,ross,"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.",8.7
S06E01,rachel,"Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.",8.7
S06E01,ross,"I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!",8.7
S06E01,rachel,What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!,8.7
S06E01,ross,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!",8.7
S06E01,rachel,"Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.",8.7
S06E01,ross,I’m asking you to do me a favor.,8.7
S06E01,rachel,You are asking me to be your wife!,8.7
S06E01,ross,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.,8.7
S06E01,monica,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,8.7
S06E01,chandler,Well you did pull his hair.,8.7

S06E01,rachel,"No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",8.7
S06E01,ross,I don’t know if it’s true.,8.7
S06E01,rachel,Oh b-b-but it is!,8.7
S06E01,ross,"Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",8.7

S06E01,phoebe,"Oh, okay.",8.7
S06E01,phoebe,"And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.",8.7
S06E01,joey,"Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh?  Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",8.7

S06E01,phoebe,You can still sleep at night and stuff.,8.7

S06E01,monica,Then all your stuff would be here.,8.7
S06E01,chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?",8.7
S06E01,monica,"Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.",8.7
S06E01,chandler,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?,8.7
S06E01,monica,Live together? There have been no signs for that.,8.7

S06E02,phoebe,"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",8.2
S06E02,ross,"Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…",8.2
S06E02,ross,"No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",8.2
S06E02,ross,Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",8.2
S06E02,ross,What?! Why?,8.2

S06E02,rachel,"Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…",8.2
S06E02,rachel,What?,8.2

S06E02,rachel,"And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.",8.2

S06E02,monica,"Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God…  Come and knock on my door…,8.2
S06E02,monica,We’ll be waiting for you…,8.2
S06E02,ross,"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Okay, what about you?  Wouldn’t you want a date?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,Whatever! What about you Meg?,8.2
S06E02,ross,What?!,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,NA,8.2
S06E02,ross,"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",8.2
S06E02,ross,"We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!,8.2
S06E02,ross,"Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, \Well done!\"" Bravo Meg.""",8.2
S06E02,ross,—Nothing!!,8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",8.2
S06E02,monica,"Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!",8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Well, Joey’s my best friend.",8.2
S06E02,monica,I’m not your best friend?,8.2
S06E02,chandler,You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?,8.2
S06E02,monica,"All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.",8.2
S06E02,chandler,Okay.,8.2

S06E02,rachel,Are you pregnant?!,8.2
S06E02,monica,"No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Um-hmm.,8.2
S06E02,monica,"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.",8.2
S06E02,monica,"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S06E02,monica,Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?,8.2
S06E02,rachel,Sure?  Thanks.,8.2
S06E02,monica,"Maybe, do you need a tissue?",8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Monica, where did you get these?!",8.2
S06E02,monica,I made them!,8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy!",8.2
S06E02,joey,"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. \You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?\"" \""Can’t",8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",8.2
S06E02,joey,Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,8.2
S06E02,chandler,Not once did we do that.,8.2
S06E02,monica,Hi.,8.2
S06E02,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S06E02,joey,Hi.,8.2
S06E02,monica,"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",8.2
S06E02,monica,"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.",8.2
S06E02,chandler,And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,8.2
S06E02,monica,"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",8.2
S06E02,joey,Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!,8.2
S06E02,chandler,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",8.2
S06E02,ross,Yes.,8.2
S06E02,ross,"Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",8.2
S06E02,ross,"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…",8.2
S06E02,ross,"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",8.2
S06E02,ross,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,8.2
S06E02,ross,I think just the annulment for today.,8.2
S06E02,ross,Easy.,8.2
S06E02,ross,No problem.,8.2
S06E02,ross,"Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",8.2
S06E02,ross,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Hey!,8.2
S06E02,monica,"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Okay!,8.2
S06E02,monica,"Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S06E02,monica,"Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!",8.2
S06E02,rachel,What the hell is that?,8.2
S06E02,monica,"I don’t know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",8.2
S06E02,monica,Something to remember me by!,8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.",8.2
S06E02,monica,"But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Are you okay? You’re not blinking.,8.2
S06E02,monica,"I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.",8.2
S06E02,monica,"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",8.2
S06E02,rachel,What is the matter with you?!,8.2
S06E02,monica,What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!,8.2
S06E02,rachel,"All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",8.2
S06E02,monica,What’s hard to believe?,8.2
S06E02,rachel,"Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.",8.2
S06E02,monica,"Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,But I…,8.2
S06E02,monica,"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,It is? Really?,8.2
S06E02,monica,"Yeah, sweetie.",8.2
S06E02,rachel,"I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?",8.2
S06E02,monica,No.,8.2
S06E02,rachel,What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much!,8.2
S06E02,monica,I’m gonna miss you!,8.2
S06E02,rachel,I mean it’s the end of an era!,8.2
S06E02,monica,I know!,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Okay, bye!",8.2
S06E02,ross,Oh no.,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,So? Did you get the annulment?,8.2
S06E02,ross,I couldn’t.,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,8.2
S06E02,ross,It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",8.2
S06E02,ross,"I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,8.2
S06E02,ross,I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!,8.2
S06E02,ross,"Ohh, what’s wrong?!",8.2
S06E02,rachel,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,8.2
S06E02,ross,Oh my—Come here! Come here!  It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.,8.2
S06E02,rachel,Thank you.,8.2
S06E02,ross,Of course.,8.2
S06E02,joey,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Oh we do, but not just yet.",8.2
S06E02,joey,"Really?! Well, when?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",8.2
S06E02,joey,Wow.,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",8.2
S06E02,joey,Great!,8.2
S06E02,phoebe,But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.,8.2
S06E02,joey,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?",8.2
S06E02,phoebe,"I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,8.2
S06E03,joey,Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Uh-huh, what?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,Oh!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,…how about I move in with you?,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",8.2
S06E03,monica,Who’s Denise?,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,My roommate.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,You have a roommate?!,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Yes, Denise. Denise!",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,8.2
S06E03,joey,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Oh, that’s true.",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,Hey.,8.2
S06E03,ross,Hey!,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,You didn’t tell her did you?,8.2
S06E03,ross,No.,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Of course not, because you’re in love with her.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"What do you mean, comforted her?",8.2
S06E03,ross,"It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",8.2
S06E03,ross,It’s also a sign of friendship.,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.",8.2
S06E03,ross,It was a hug!,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",8.2
S06E03,ross,S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Who was it?,8.2
S06E03,joey,"I don’t know! How about, \Thanks for taking the message.\"" Jeez!""",8.2
S06E03,monica,"Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Sure!,8.2
S06E03,monica,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",8.2
S06E03,monica,No.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Okay so you mean no as in, \Gee Chandler",8.2
S06E03,monica,"Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"So, that’s it?",8.2
S06E03,monica,I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!,8.2
S06E03,monica,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",8.2
S06E03,monica,Are you mocking me?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"No, I’m not mocking you,",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Hey, what’s up?",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",8.2
S06E03,joey,"But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,\Wanted. Female roommate,8.2
S06E03,joey,"Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh?  Not just a hat rack my friend!",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Pheebs, I have to ask you…",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,You’re just staring into space.,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,This one?,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,It worked!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  \Wanted. Female roommate",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Wait, no, look at this!  \Two bedroom",8.2
S06E03,ross,Hey!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,Hey.,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,Yeah! Why?,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Okay, you go grab it!",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,I saw it.,8.2
S06E03,ross,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Look, I do not re-love her.",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.",8.2
S06E03,ross,You can live with me.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,What?!,8.2
S06E03,phoebe,What?!,8.2
S06E03,ross,What?,8.2
S06E03,rachel,Oh my God! Are you serious?!,8.2
S06E03,ross,Uh-huh.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Oh please!  You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,"No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me!  Okay, that’s a lie.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Hi.,8.2
S06E03,monica,Hi.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…",8.2
S06E03,monica,Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Really?,8.2
S06E03,monica,Yeah! Oh yes!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Ohh.,8.2
S06E03,monica,"Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,8.2
S06E03,monica,Totally!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,We don’t have to come up with this now.,8.2
S06E03,monica,Oh good.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",8.2
S06E03,monica,Changes?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.",8.2
S06E03,monica,You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Is that a problem?,8.2
S06E03,monica,"Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",8.2
S06E03,monica,See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",8.2
S06E03,monica,"Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!",8.2
S06E03,chandler,In the game room!,8.2
S06E03,monica,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!!,8.2
S06E03,joey,"Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",8.2
S06E03,chandler,NA,8.2
S06E03,joey,"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,8.2
S06E03,joey,That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,Hey!,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",8.2
S06E03,ross,What?! Over a stupid room!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",8.2
S06E03,monica,"Ross, we can handle this.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",8.2
S06E03,monica,Love is the best medicine.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,That’s laughter.,8.2
S06E03,monica,Why do you do it?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,I don’t know.,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Yeah, I do.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",8.2

S06E03,rachel,"No-no, I’m staying put.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Why, where are you going?",8.2
S06E03,ross,Hey Rach!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,Hi!,8.2

S06E03,rachel,Oh wow.,8.2
S06E03,ross,"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Well, because of us! Because of our history.",8.2
S06E03,ross,No!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,No?,8.2
S06E03,ross,"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,No! Not at all!,8.2
S06E03,ross,Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",8.2
S06E03,ross,Really?! We are?,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…",8.2
S06E03,ross,Ohh! That would be great.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, \Come back later",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Yeah, I didn’t think of that.",8.2
S06E03,ross,So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!,8.2
S06E03,monica,That’s very funny!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!",8.2
S06E03,monica,"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!",8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Yeah, I'm not so worried.",8.2
S06E03,monica,"Yeah, no, me neither.",8.2
S06E03,ross,Fine! It’s your life!,8.2
S06E03,monica,You still want to move in together right?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Of course!,8.2
S06E03,monica,Ross didn’t scare you?,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,8.2
S06E03,monica,"Come here, I want to show you something!",8.2
S06E03,chandler,Okay!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!,8.2
S06E03,monica,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!,8.2
S06E03,monica,Okay!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say \Merge?\""",8.2
S06E03,monica,Uh-hmm.,8.2
S06E03,chandler,"Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!",8.2
S06E03,monica,Oh my God! I love that!,8.2
S06E03,chandler,Really?!,8.2
S06E03,monica,"Uh, no!!",8.2
S06E03,phoebe,I found you in my bed!,8.2

S06E03,ross,"So umm, where are the other guys?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.",8.2
S06E03,ross,Fighting?!,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?",8.2
S06E03,ross,Sure! Here.,8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Thank you.  Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back.",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Yeah, I’m-I’m sure.",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?",8.2
S06E03,ross,I’ve been back and forth.,8.2
S06E03,joey,"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.",8.2
S06E03,joey,"That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, \Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone.\"" And then",8.2
S06E03,ross,"Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.",8.2
S06E03,joey,"I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?",8.2

S06E03,ross,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!",8.2
S06E03,joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",8.2
S06E03,rachel,"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!",8.2
S06E03,joey,Hi!,8.2
S06E03,joey,"Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!",8.2
S06E03,joey,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",8.2

S06E04,rachel,What?!,8.2
S06E04,ross,"You complete me kitchen, matey!",8.2
S06E04,phoebe,"Ross, I know what you’re thinking.",8.2
S06E04,ross,What?,8.2
S06E04,phoebe,"That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",8.2
S06E04,ross,Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!,8.2

S06E04,chandler,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?,8.2
S06E04,phoebe,"No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!",8.2
S06E04,ross,Hey everyone!,8.2

S06E04,joey,Let me see that!,8.2
S06E04,chandler,All right.,8.2
S06E04,joey,"Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!",8.2
S06E04,chandler,"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",8.2

S06E04,rachel,"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",8.2
S06E04,ross,They’re not listening too me?,8.2
S06E04,rachel,Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,8.2
S06E04,ross,Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,8.2
S06E04,monica,I think you look fine.,8.2
S06E04,joey,Okay. \Hey,8.2
S06E04,joey,"Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second.  \Hey Timmy",8.2
S06E04,joey,So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!,8.2
S06E04,joey,Exactly.,8.2
S06E04,joey,"Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today.  I didn’t get it, did I?",8.2

S06E04,rachel,Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!,8.2
S06E04,ross,NA,8.2
S06E04,ross,"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…",8.2
S06E04,rachel,"Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!",8.2
S06E04,ross,"Well, hello Rachel!",8.2
S06E04,phoebe,Have you really done this before?,8.2
S06E04,joey,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back.",8.2
S06E04,phoebe,Hey!,8.2
S06E04,joey,Hey-hey-hey!,8.2
S06E04,chandler,What are you doing?,8.2
S06E04,phoebe,We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.,8.2
S06E04,chandler,"Oh, all right.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!,8.2
S06E05,ross,Look I was going to tell you!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.,8.2
S06E05,chandler,What?,8.2
S06E05,monica,You’re kidding!,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Oh my God!!,8.2
S06E05,monica,Ross!,8.2
S06E05,ross,"Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Another lie. You have a sickness!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?",8.2
S06E05,joey,Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?,8.2
S06E05,monica,"Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?",8.2
S06E05,joey,There’s a lost and found?,8.2
S06E05,chandler,You left a shoe here?!,8.2
S06E05,joey,"Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.",8.2
S06E05,joey,Great! Thanks.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!",8.2
S06E05,monica,"Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Yeah, all right.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya!",8.2
S06E05,chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!,8.2
S06E05,monica,"Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.",8.2
S06E05,monica,"Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when——people with babies come to visit.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Yeah, it’s not mine.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Yeah, it’s  mine.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?",8.2
S06E05,joey,It’s got ‘em!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Maybe you could be my roommate!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,Well there’s an idea!!,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Yeah!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Okay Rach, but…",8.2
S06E05,rachel,Op! You’re peeping!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!",8.2
S06E05,ross,Look I told you…,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"I don’t wanna hear \Three failed marriages!\""",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!",8.2
S06E05,ross,What about the time I said we were on a break?,8.2
S06E05,rachel,Ugh!,8.2
S06E05,monica,"Pheebs, how’s it going?",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?,8.2
S06E05,monica,"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.,8.2
S06E05,monica,What do you mean?,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around…",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",8.2
S06E05,monica,This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.,8.2
S06E05,joey,Hey guys!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,Hey!,8.2
S06E05,joey,"Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!",8.2
S06E05,chandler,Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,8.2
S06E05,joey,"You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,What equity investments?,8.2
S06E05,joey,"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",8.2
S06E05,monica,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,You don’t even have a car!,8.2
S06E05,monica,"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,And?,8.2
S06E05,monica,And six others.,8.2
S06E05,chandler,There you are.,8.2
S06E05,joey,"Yeah, she tops out at 130.",8.2
S06E05,joey,And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.,8.2
S06E05,joey,Sure!,8.2
S06E05,joey,"Okay, take it easy.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Yeah, but it’s my wax.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Sure. Here.  I’ll uh, save your parking spot.",8.2
S06E05,joey,Why not?,8.2
S06E05,joey,"Yeah, so did I.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.,8.2
S06E05,monica,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,NA,8.2
S06E05,monica,"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",8.2
S06E05,chandler,He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,What?!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Glass, sand, whatever.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",8.2
S06E05,monica,Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Oh, I can still do that.",8.2
S06E05,monica,How are you still single?!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.,8.2
S06E05,monica,Good. What made you change your mind?,8.2
S06E05,chandler,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,How did that happen?!!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.",8.2
S06E05,monica,"Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",8.2
S06E05,ross,What?!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",8.2
S06E05,ross,Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, you would know.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Oh, come on!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",8.2
S06E05,ross,And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,Ugh!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike \Consummated like bunnies\"" from the record?""",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,8.2
S06E05,ross,And what— Stop typing! Stop typing!!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",8.2
S06E05,ross,Yeah!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,And thank you for your time.,8.2
S06E05,joey,So the Porsche guy took his car back.,8.2
S06E05,chandler,But you found the keys to his clothes?,8.2
S06E05,joey,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",8.2
S06E05,monica,And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?,8.2
S06E05,joey,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?,8.2
S06E05,chandler,That is true.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",8.2
S06E05,joey,"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.",8.2
S06E05,monica,"Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",8.2
S06E05,joey,Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",8.2
S06E05,monica,"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!",8.2
S06E05,monica,"The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,8.2
S06E05,monica,"He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,I think that’s gum.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,I’m pretty sure it’s gun.,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!,8.2
S06E05,joey,Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?,8.2
S06E05,joey,Porsche.,8.2
S06E05,rachel,This is totally your fault!,8.2
S06E05,ross,My fault?! You threatened the judge!,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",8.2
S06E05,ross,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,8.2
S06E05,joey,Hi! How are the Gellers?,8.2
S06E05,rachel,Don’t call us that!,8.2
S06E05,ross,The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,8.2
S06E05,joey,Hey! It’s Porsche!!,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, \Yeah",8.2
S06E05,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,How do you feel?,8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",8.2
S06E05,chandler,And protected them from a tornado?,8.2
S06E05,monica,Oh my God.,8.2
S06E05,phoebe,"I know, the babies are asleep.",8.2
S06E05,monica,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",8.2
S06E05,phoebe,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,8.2
S06E05,monica,But my apartment!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.,8.2
S06E05,monica,But the mess!,8.2
S06E05,chandler,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,8.2
S06E05,monica,"You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",8.2
S06E05,chandler,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!",8.2
S06E05,rachel,Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!,8.2
S06E05,ross,Yeah! Right!,8.2
S06E05,ross,"You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right?  What?",8.2
S06E05,rachel,Nothing.,8.2
S06E05,ross,"Okay, can we just sign please?",8.2
S06E05,rachel,Uh-hmm.,8.2
S06E05,ross,Congratulations.,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",8.2
S06E05,ross,What?,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",8.2
S06E05,ross,Excuse me?,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",8.2
S06E05,ross,Yeah?,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Yeah, don’t push it though.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Did I, did I even treat?",8.2
S06E05,rachel,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",8.2
S06E05,ross,That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.,8.2
S06E05,rachel,"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",8.2
S06E05,ross,"Eh, no problem.",8.2
S06E05,rachel,I’m gonna need a copy of those.,8.2
S06E05,ross,Totally.,8.2
S06E05,joey,Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,8.2
S06E05,joey,Hey! How you doin’?,8.2
S06E05,joey,"I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.",8.2
S06E06,chandler,"Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",8.5
S06E06,joey,Right! And when is that due?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,First of the month.,8.5
S06E06,joey,And that’s every month?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"No, just the months you actually want to live here.",8.5
S06E06,joey,Ahhh.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay, here is the phone bill.",8.5
S06E06,joey,Oh my God!!,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?",8.5
S06E06,joey,No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"It’s not charity, Joe…",8.5
S06E06,joey,"No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay uh, here’s the electric bill.",8.5
S06E06,joey,This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Uh, yeah.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Well, how much do you think he needs?",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Well that would help the pride thing.,8.5
S06E06,monica,Hey!,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,8.5
S06E06,monica,Okay.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"And also, my birthday.",8.5
S06E06,monica,It’s not your birthday.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!,8.5
S06E06,joey,Hey!,8.5
S06E06,ross,Hey!,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Hey!,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",8.5
S06E06,ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.",8.5
S06E06,joey,"I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",8.5
S06E06,ross,I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Pheebs, I was wondering…",8.5
S06E06,monica,You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,Well and clearly not a minute sooner.,8.5
S06E06,monica,"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Yeah, yeah, I know.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!",8.5
S06E06,rachel,Surprise!!,8.5
S06E06,monica,What?,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, \What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!\"" Right? But you love packing! So",8.5
S06E06,monica,"I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,I have plans.,8.5
S06E06,monica,You’re plans were with us.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,That’s right.,8.5
S06E06,monica,"All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Okay.,8.5
S06E06,monica,"Okay!  Oh my God, thank you!!",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.",8.5
S06E06,monica,I thought you said you were going to do nothing.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Yes, but for the last time.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Okay fine, now Ross…",8.5
S06E06,ross,"Oh, but-but I can’t do it.",8.5
S06E06,monica,Why not?,8.5
S06E06,joey,I’ve got Ben.,8.5
S06E06,ross,"Because, because I’ve got Ben.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",8.5
S06E06,chandler,He’s at a dinner party.,8.5
S06E06,monica,Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,8.5
S06E06,ross,"Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",8.5
S06E06,monica,"All right, sorry.",8.5
S06E06,ross,I gotta go make a fake Ben.,8.5
S06E06,joey,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",8.5
S06E06,joey,"Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",8.5
S06E06,joey,"What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,8.5
S06E06,joey,"Okay, you’re on.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.",8.5
S06E06,monica,Oh God!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,You remember when we got these?,8.5
S06E06,monica,No.,8.5
S06E06,rachel,I guess you weren’t there.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time…  You don’t remember?",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.",8.5
S06E06,monica,I’m gonna miss you so much.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",8.5
S06E06,monica,I don’t think there’s anything.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Come on, there’s gotta be something.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Nope, she’s perfect.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,I have one.,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Good! Great! You can go first.,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?",8.5
S06E06,monica,Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,8.5
S06E06,rachel,You get your messages!,8.5
S06E06,monica,"Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Great! It worked! No one’s sad.,8.5
S06E06,joey,I gotta buy some food.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",8.5
S06E06,joey,You serious?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Oh yes!,8.5
S06E06,joey,"Okay, get ready to owe me!",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Okay.,8.5
S06E06,joey,"Okay, here we go. Ready?",8.5
S06E06,chandler,No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.",8.5
S06E06,monica,Hello?  See? Other people call me!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Ooh, your brother. Score!",8.5
S06E06,monica,What’s up?,8.5
S06E06,ross,"Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Oh, put him on!",8.5
S06E06,ross,"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"You know what else I’m not gonna miss? \I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!\""",8.5
S06E06,monica,\Hi I’m Rachel,8.5
S06E06,rachel,\I’m Monica,8.5

S06E06,phoebe,"Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Still broken?,8.5
S06E06,joey,"This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?",8.5
S06E06,joey,"Nah, not my game.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.",8.5
S06E06,joey,"Well, what’s it called?",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Cups.,8.5
S06E06,joey,I don’t know how to play Cups.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.",8.5
S06E06,joey,All right.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?",8.5

S06E06,joey,No. Why?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Well that’s a full cup!,8.5
S06E06,joey,Damn! I am good at Cups!,8.5
S06E06,monica,I’m not talking to her!,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"I know, I took it hard too.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing?",8.5
S06E06,rachel,I’m unpacking!,8.5
S06E06,monica,What?!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,I’m not moving!  Is that picture straight?,8.5
S06E06,monica,It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!",8.5
S06E06,monica,Because it’s my apartment!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!,8.5
S06E06,monica,"How about, you’re moving!!",8.5
S06E06,rachel,Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Hey, how are you guys doing?",8.5

S06E06,monica,I am not!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!!  I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.",8.5
S06E06,monica,No Phoebe I am mad!,8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Well, deep-deep-deep down!",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Yeah, I’m just mad!",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Then keep running.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,You win.,8.5
S06E06,joey,"Well, what did you have?",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?",8.5
S06E06,joey,"Uh,  wow, 700.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Not 700 exactly?,8.5
S06E06,joey,Yeah.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Double it!,8.5
S06E06,joey,What?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",8.5
S06E06,joey,Really?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, \What were you thinking?\""",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!,8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,Oh really? Like what Monica?,8.5
S06E06,monica,"Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Oh yeah, good start Mon.",8.5
S06E06,monica,She lets you borrow them.,8.5
S06E06,rachel,Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.,8.5
S06E06,monica,"Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,What else?,8.5
S06E06,monica,"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.,8.5
S06E06,monica,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.",8.5
S06E06,monica,"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"Oh, it’s gonna be fine.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,"Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!",8.5
S06E06,rachel,"But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.",8.5
S06E06,phoebe,Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?,8.5
S06E06,monica,Kinda.  Oh my God!,8.5
S06E06,ross,"Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.",8.5
S06E06,joey,Hey!,8.5
S06E06,chandler,What’s wrong?,8.5
S06E06,joey,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!,8.5
S06E06,joey,"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Oh man!!,8.5
S06E06,joey,"And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!",8.5
S06E06,joey,"No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!,8.5
S06E06,joey,"It’s him, not it!",8.5
S06E06,chandler,"No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?",8.5
S06E06,joey,"Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!",8.5
S06E06,chandler,When did I try to give you money?,8.5
S06E06,joey,"Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said \No",8.5
S06E06,chandler,I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.,8.5
S06E06,joey,"I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.",8.5
S06E06,monica,Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?,8.5
S06E06,rachel,Okay.,8.5
S06E06,monica,I’m really gonna miss you.,8.5
S06E06,rachel,Oh! I have your key. Here you go.,8.5

S06E06,monica,Thank you.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,No problem roomie.,8.5
S06E06,monica,Can I ask you a question?,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Sure!,8.5
S06E06,monica,What the hell is that dog doing here?!,8.5
S06E06,chandler,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.,8.5
S06E06,ross,And now you want that money back.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,Exactly.,8.5
S06E06,ross,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?",8.5
S06E06,chandler,It’s not a real game! I made it up!,8.5
S06E06,ross,"I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,At a fake game!!,8.5
S06E06,ross,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.",8.5
S06E06,chandler,Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.,8.5
S06E06,ross,No.,8.5
S06E06,chandler,"Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time.",8.5
S06E07,phoebe,Ready?,8.4

S06E07,rachel,Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!,8.4
S06E07,phoebe,Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.,8.4
S06E07,ross,"So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.,8.4
S06E07,monica,Hey!,8.4
S06E07,monica,"Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!",8.4

S06E07,chandler,"I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.",8.4
S06E07,monica,Hi!,8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Hey Mon, how's it going?",8.4
S06E07,monica,"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",8.4
S06E07,monica,It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.,8.4
S06E07,chandler,No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.,8.4
S06E07,monica,"Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?",8.4

S06E07,ross,"Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!",8.4
S06E07,joey,"Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Hey, I've been married 3 times",8.4
S06E07,joey,"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go \ba dum bum chessh\""",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,That's not specific to girls.,8.4
S06E07,joey,"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",8.4
S06E07,ross,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,8.4
S06E07,ross,They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",8.4
S06E07,ross,I'm never gonna find love again.,8.4
S06E07,rachel,"Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,Sure,8.4
S06E07,rachel,"Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,"So, what should you have done?",8.4
S06E07,rachel,"Well, I-I should've told you the truth.",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,"Uh-Huh, Which is...?",8.4
S06E07,rachel,"Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,So?,8.4
S06E07,rachel,"Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,Why do you care?,8.4
S06E07,rachel,Because they're people.,8.4
S06E07,phoebe,But people that you don't know and will never see again.,8.4
S06E07,rachel,"Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,"Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.",8.4
S06E07,rachel,"I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.",8.4
S06E07,phoebe,"That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",8.4
S06E07,ross,Who cares? I repel women.,8.4

S06E07,chandler,I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.,8.4
S06E07,ross,Why does anyone have to be naked?,8.4
S06E07,monica,Why is Ross naked?,8.4
S06E07,ross,I-I had to show Chandler something?,8.4

S06E07,ross,"Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.",8.4
S06E07,monica,Is it the same thing that Chandler had?,8.4

S06E07,chandler,That's perfect! That's brilliant!,8.4
S06E07,ross,"So really, what'd ya have?",8.4
S06E07,joey,"Uh, don't you mean \for whom?\""",8.4
S06E07,joey,"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",8.4
S06E07,joey,"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",8.4
S06E07,joey,"No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?",8.4
S06E07,joey,Oh!,8.4
S06E07,joey,"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",8.4
S06E07,joey,"Oh, I do.  How you doin?",8.4

S06E07,monica,Why is everything different?,8.4
S06E07,ross,Bye!,8.4
S06E07,chandler,"No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.",8.4
S06E07,monica,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",8.4
S06E07,chandler,"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",8.4
S06E07,monica,"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",8.4
S06E07,chandler,Do you want me to be afraid of you?,8.4
S06E07,monica,"Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",8.4

S06E07,ross,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...",8.4
S06E07,ross,"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.",8.4

S06E08,chandler,That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.,8.5
S06E08,monica,I don’t think mine likes me either.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Maybe it’s a universal thing?,8.5

S06E08,ross,A-A day.,8.5
S06E08,monica,Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?,8.5
S06E08,ross,"I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"No, no no no. You’ll be fine.  Hillary’s bind, right?",8.5
S06E08,monica,She will be after tonight.,8.5
S06E08,chandler,Yeah.,8.5
S06E08,ross,"Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,What???,8.5
S06E08,monica,Oh my god.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,I am proud of all my friends today.,8.5
S06E08,monica,"My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy",8.5
S06E08,monica,"Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,"Hey. Here.  Ohh, who’s the silver fox?",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him?  Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,What?,8.5
S06E08,phoebe,"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,What?,8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?,8.5
S06E08,rachel,To get you to make out with him!!!,8.5
S06E08,phoebe,Ohhh.,8.5
S06E08,monica,"Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.",8.5
S06E08,ross,I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.,8.5
S06E08,monica,"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.",8.5
S06E08,ross,Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.,8.5
S06E08,monica,"I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.",8.5
S06E08,ross,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.,8.5
S06E08,monica,Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.,8.5
S06E08,ross,"But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?",8.5
S06E08,monica,Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.,8.5
S06E08,ross,What??,8.5
S06E08,monica,"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.",8.5
S06E08,ross,No. I am not putting on makeup.,8.5
S06E08,phoebe,Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?  OH!! Demon!! Demon!!,8.5
S06E08,monica,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.,8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.",8.5
S06E08,monica,"Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.",8.5
S06E08,monica,"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.",8.5
S06E08,monica,Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.,8.5
S06E08,chandler,You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?,8.5
S06E08,monica,"When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear.  I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.",8.5
S06E08,joey,Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.,8.5
S06E08,chandler,"No thanks, Josephine.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Ohh, hi, Kim.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,No.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Mmm-Hmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Mmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Mm-Hmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Hmm-Hmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Mmm-Unmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.",8.5
S06E08,joey,"So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",8.5
S06E08,monica,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",8.5
S06E08,monica,"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",8.5
S06E08,joey,"Ohh, I love birds.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,What is the matter with you ?!?,8.5
S06E08,joey,What?,8.5
S06E08,chandler,"You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!",8.5
S06E08,joey,"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",8.5
S06E08,chandler,You’re turning into a women.,8.5
S06E08,joey,No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.,8.5
S06E08,chandler,Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?,8.5
S06E08,joey,"It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.,8.5
S06E08,phoebe,"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,Just for a second.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,"I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",8.5
S06E08,phoebe,"Ohh, sleep with Kenny.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,That wouldn’t help me.,8.5
S06E08,phoebe,"Ohh, yes it would.",8.5
S06E08,ross,Mmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,NA,8.5
S06E08,ross,Mmmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Hmm-Hmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,Mmm-Hmm.,8.5
S06E08,ross,How about all the way.,8.5
S06E08,ross,"So, ahh, where were we?",8.5
S06E08,ross,"Ohh, you can see them, huh?",8.5
S06E08,ross,"I-I, did that for you.",8.5
S06E08,ross,What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!,8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Kim, hi.",8.5
S06E08,rachel,Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,"Yeah, he dumped me. He said, \Rachel",8.5
S06E08,rachel,Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.,8.5
S06E08,rachel,You and Ralph?,8.5
S06E08,joey,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.",8.5
S06E08,joey,"I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.",8.5
S06E08,joey,"Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.",8.5
S06E08,joey,"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.",8.5
S06E08,joey,And a couple of these little tiny boxes.,8.5
S06E08,joey,Okay.,8.5
S06E09,monica,So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?,9.2
S06E09,chandler,Sydney Portier? Hehheh.,9.2
S06E09,monica,"No, my parents.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Why can’t I tell them that we live together?,9.2
S06E09,monica,Because they don’t know we’re dating.,9.2
S06E09,chandler,Why haven’t you told them?!,9.2
S06E09,monica,"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!,9.2
S06E09,monica,NA,9.2
S06E09,chandler,Why wouldn’t they be happy?,9.2
S06E09,monica,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,What? What? Why?!,9.2
S06E09,monica,"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?,9.2
S06E09,monica,"Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.",9.2
S06E09,monica,You really think that’ll work?,9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?",9.2
S06E09,monica,I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!,9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Hey!  Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Yes, of course they like you!",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Well Monica just told me that they don’t.,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Yeah, they don’t like you.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Do you know why?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!,9.2
S06E09,chandler,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.,9.2
S06E09,joey,Well maybe I love ya’.,9.2
S06E09,chandler,[mocks that last comment].,9.2
S06E09,chandler,Hey.,9.2
S06E09,ross,"No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?",9.2
S06E09,ross,For real?,9.2
S06E09,joey,"Ye-ye, we go to yours!",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,Hey!,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!",9.2
S06E09,monica,Nothing.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,Nothing?,9.2
S06E09,monica,"No, sweetie, I-I trust you.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?",9.2
S06E09,monica,You’re not gonna mess it up.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!",9.2
S06E09,ross,And the place looks so nice!,9.2
S06E09,joey,"Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!",9.2
S06E09,ross,Happy Thanksgiving!,9.2
S06E09,joey,"Well, this has been great!",9.2
S06E09,ross,See ya!,9.2
S06E09,monica,Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Some would say she’s attractive, yes.",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,And who else is going to be there?,9.2
S06E09,joey,"Uh, some of her friends, yeah.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,Her dancer friends?,9.2
S06E09,joey,"Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Dude, we were good!",9.2
S06E09,monica,"You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Whoa, snowing out there?",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,Really?!,9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.\"",9.2
S06E09""",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.,9.2
S06E09,joey,"Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Yeah, yeah, what is it?",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",9.2
S06E09,ross,W-What was the one right before bananas?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?",9.2
S06E09,joey,Y-sure!,9.2
S06E09,rachel,And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!",9.2
S06E09,joey,"I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!",9.2
S06E09,joey,Chandler!,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!",9.2
S06E09,joey,Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!,9.2
S06E09,ross,"No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.",9.2
S06E09,joey,Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!",9.2
S06E09,joey,Vomiting stories are funny...,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",9.2
S06E09,joey,Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,No!,9.2
S06E09,joey,Still not hot enough!,9.2
S06E09,phoebe,Rachel?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,Yeah?,9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of  condensed milk.",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]",9.2
S06E09,chandler,What?,9.2
S06E09,monica,What?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,You do? Why?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,What?! Why did you do that?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,How could it not matter?!,9.2
S06E09,ross,"How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?",9.2
S06E09,chandler,What about all that “friends forever” stuff?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"I don’t know, I-I was all high.",9.2
S06E09,monica,Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!,9.2
S06E09,chandler,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,9.2
S06E09,monica,"Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?",9.2
S06E09,monica,You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Monica, leave him alone!",9.2
S06E09,joey,Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",9.2
S06E09,joey,Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",9.2
S06E09,joey,Oh I am!,9.2
S06E09,monica,"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Okay, fine!",9.2
S06E09,joey,Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.",9.2
S06E09,ross,"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Dude, they’re not objects.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?",9.2
S06E09,rachel,Okay...,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"What’s up, Ross?",9.2
S06E09,ross,"So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?",9.2
S06E09,rachel,Yeah!,9.2
S06E09,ross,And um...You look nice today.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.",9.2
S06E09,ross,What?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.,9.2
S06E09,ross,Eh?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",9.2
S06E09,ross,You’re alone.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Oh and , okay?",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.",9.2
S06E09,joey,Really?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?",9.2
S06E09,rachel,It sure is.,9.2
S06E09,phoebe,Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,Beef.,9.2
S06E09,phoebe,I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat.  Ohhh no.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.",9.2
S06E09,monica,Really?,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!",9.2
S06E09,monica,Okay.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,Well?,9.2
S06E09,monica,Mmmm! It’s good!,9.2
S06E09,rachel,Really? How good?,9.2
S06E09,monica,"It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.",9.2
S06E09,monica,"I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.",9.2
S06E09,ross,Wha? No no! Ah!  All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.,9.2
S06E09,ross,It tastes like feet!,9.2
S06E09,joey,I like it.,9.2
S06E09,ross,Are you kidding?,9.2
S06E09,joey,What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?",9.2
S06E09,chandler,"Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Rachel, come here.  Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.",9.2
S06E09,rachel,"Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.",9.2
S06E09,phoebe,"Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.",9.2
S06E09,monica,Ross? Let’s go.,9.2
S06E09,ross,"Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.",9.2
S06E09,ross,Wha-what?,9.2
S06E09,monica,Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!,9.2
S06E09,ross,"You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?",9.2
S06E09,ross,Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.,9.2
S06E09,monica,"And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!",9.2
S06E09,ross,"Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!",9.2
S06E09,monica,Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!,9.2
S06E09,ross,Monica and Chandler are living together!,9.2
S06E09,monica,Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!,9.2
S06E09,phoebe,I love Jacques Cousteau!,9.2
S06E09,rachel,I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!,9.2
S06E09,joey,I wanna gooooooo!,9.2
S06E09,ross,"I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!",9.2
S06E09,chandler,Thank you!,9.2
S06E09,chandler,I’ll talk to them!,9.2
S06E09,rachel,"You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!",9.2
S06E09,monica,"Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"No it isn’t, I ate that.",9.2
S06E09,joey,"Nope, got it and I got yours  too.",9.2
S06E10,chandler,"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"That’s a good story, Grandpa.",8.6
S06E10,ross,Hey,8.6
S06E10,ross,"Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",8.6
S06E10,monica,Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.,8.6
S06E10,phoebe,That is nice and we’re done. TADA!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.",8.6
S06E10,monica,"Oh, here.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,See now it feels like Christmas!,8.6
S06E10,ross,"… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",8.6
S06E10,joey,Hey you guys.,8.6
S06E10,chandler,Hey Joe what’s up?,8.6
S06E10,joey,"I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like…",8.6
S06E10,chandler,I can see why that’s hard to resist.,8.6
S06E10,joey,I like her so much!,8.6
S06E10,monica,"Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",8.6
S06E10,joey,I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?",8.6
S06E10,ross,"I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",8.6
S06E10,ross,Hi Janine!,8.6
S06E10,monica,Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?,8.6
S06E10,monica,Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?",8.6
S06E10,ross,You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!,8.6
S06E10,joey,Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.,8.6
S06E10,ross,"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.",8.6
S06E10,ross,Are you serious?,8.6
S06E10,monica,We are there!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"What, what are you laughing at?",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",8.6
S06E10,ross,Bye Janine!,8.6
S06E10,joey,Did she just ask me out on a date?,8.6
S06E10,chandler,I don’t think so.,8.6
S06E10,monica,What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!,8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",8.6
S06E10,ross,It was a dry day.,8.6
S06E10,monica,We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!,8.6
S06E10,ross,Oh my God!,8.6
S06E10,monica,Oh my God!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,Oh my God!,8.6
S06E10,joey,"OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.",8.6
S06E10,ross,Got it!,8.6
S06E10,ross,Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!,8.6
S06E10,ross,"Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?",8.6
S06E10,joey,Ross! So when is it gonna air?,8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.",8.6
S06E10,rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,8.6
S06E10,chandler,What? That’s terrible!,8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"No-no, we do it every year!",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Oh well, that makes it not terrible.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,But we have to!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Well then, you should look with us.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,Why?,8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Oh, that’s it?  A great idea!",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"If I help, we can find ‘em faster!",8.6
S06E10,rachel,That’s right!,8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Ooh, who’s it for?",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,Uh-oh. She may be onto us.,8.6
S06E10,rachel,We are so gonna find them this year.,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?",8.6
S06E10,rachel,Yeah.,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!",8.6
S06E10,monica,"Okay, here comes another camera.",8.6
S06E10,ross,Right. No biggie. Stay loose.,8.6
S06E10,ross,Why do they keep doing that?,8.6
S06E10,monica,"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.",8.6
S06E10,ross,Right.,8.6
S06E10,ross,"Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?",8.6
S06E10,monica,Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?,8.6
S06E10,ross,Yeah!,8.6
S06E10,joey,Really?,8.6
S06E10,joey,What do you mean?,8.6
S06E10,joey,Uh-huh.,8.6
S06E10,joey,No-no-no-no-no we came together!,8.6
S06E10,joey,"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Those are my gifts, I got them for you.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!,8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?",8.6
S06E10,chandler,Those are book ends! That's a great gift!,8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.",8.6
S06E10,rachel,Ha!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!",8.6
S06E10,joey,Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Looking good Gellers!,8.6
S06E10,ross,We know!,8.6
S06E10,monica,"Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.",8.6
S06E10,ross,Okay.,8.6
S06E10,monica,"Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?",8.6
S06E10,ross,Monica!  Would it?,8.6
S06E10,joey,"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair,",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants.",8.6
S06E10,monica,"Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?",8.6
S06E10,ross,"Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!",8.6
S06E10,monica,What?,8.6
S06E10,ross,The routine!,8.6
S06E10,monica,"Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.",8.6
S06E10,ross,"Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!",8.6
S06E10,monica,Was it really that good?,8.6
S06E10,ross,"We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?",8.6
S06E10,monica,"Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!",8.6
S06E10,monica,5 6 7 8!,8.6
S06E10,ross,"So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?",8.6
S06E10,monica,Yes!,8.6
S06E10,joey,"Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Yeah, take a hike wetpants!",8.6
S06E10,ross,Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!,8.6
S06E10,monica,"I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?",8.6
S06E10,ross,No!,8.6
S06E10,monica,Me too!,8.6
S06E10,ross,"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know?",8.6
S06E10,monica,"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!",8.6
S06E10,joey,No! Year! Happy No Year!,8.6
S06E10,phoebe,Hey! Look who I found!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Oh, hey guys!",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"Hmm, how about my azzz?",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Hey, this is hollow.",8.6

S06E10,rachel,"This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,"No, don’t look directly at them!",8.6

S06E10,chandler,Okay! Okay! Okay!,8.6
S06E10,phoebe,Hee hee!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Wait, we can’t do this.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.",8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?",8.6
S06E10,phoebe,Will you get us better gifts?,8.6
S06E10,chandler,Fine!,8.6
S06E10,monica,"Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?",8.6

S06E10,phoebe,"Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!",8.6
S06E10,joey,Yeah?,8.6
S06E10,joey,"Oh, yoii. What was that for?",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.",8.6
S06E10,joey,But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?,8.6
S06E10,joey,No.,8.6
S06E10,joey,"3, 2,",8.6
S06E10,joey,"Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.",8.6
S06E10,monica,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",8.6
S06E10,rachel,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",8.6
S06E10,monica,"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!",8.6
S06E10,rachel,‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!,8.6
S06E10,monica,What? We could do it!,8.6
S06E10,ross,"I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.",8.6
S06E10,monica,"I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go.",8.6
S06E10,monica,I can’t do it!,8.6
S06E10,chandler,"Now you do that, you’re on TV.",8.6

S06E11,monica,"Honey, we have been through this before!",8.1
S06E11,rachel,Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.,8.1
S06E11,phoebe,"She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.",8.1
S06E11,joey,"Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!",8.1
S06E11,monica,You serious?!,8.1
S06E11,chandler,That’s great!,8.1
S06E11,monica,Really?!,8.1

S06E11,rachel,Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.,8.1
S06E11,monica,You got it from Pottery Barn?!,8.1

S06E11,rachel,Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!,8.1

S06E11,rachel,I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.,8.1
S06E11,ross,Why did you do that?,8.1
S06E11,rachel,Because she hates Pottery Barn.,8.1
S06E11,ross,She hates Pottery Barn?!!,8.1
S06E11,rachel,"I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?",8.1
S06E11,ross,"What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!",8.1

S06E11,rachel,"Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.",8.1
S06E11,ross,Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.,8.1
S06E11,rachel,"Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.",8.1

S06E11,chandler,"Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!",8.1
S06E11,joey,"Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.",8.1
S06E11,monica,What?,8.1
S06E11,chandler,So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!,8.1
S06E11,monica,"Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!",8.1
S06E11,chandler,"And I am not blah, I am a hoot!",8.1

S06E11,monica,We didn’t give you any money!,8.1
S06E11,joey,You don’t think I know that!,8.1
S06E11,rachel,"…see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.",8.1
S06E11,ross,Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.,8.1
S06E11,rachel,"I know, I know. I went a little crazy.",8.1

S06E11,rachel,"Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.",8.1
S06E11,phoebe,"Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.",8.1
S06E11,rachel,Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.,8.1
S06E11,phoebe,"Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.",8.1
S06E11,ross,"Really?!  Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.",8.1

S06E11,phoebe,"No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!",8.1
S06E11,rachel,"Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.",8.1
S06E11,phoebe,I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?,8.1
S06E11,rachel,What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!,8.1
S06E11,phoebe,But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?,8.1
S06E11,rachel,Oh. Yes! I would so move out!,8.1
S06E11,phoebe,Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!,8.1
S06E11,rachel,That’s right!,8.1
S06E11,phoebe,But at least the apothecary table is real.,8.1
S06E11,joey,"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?",8.1
S06E11,chandler,That’s totally understandable.,8.1

S06E11,joey,"I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t.  I’m very upset.",8.1
S06E11,joey,Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.,8.1
S06E11,monica,What did I tell you about the hall?!,8.1
S06E11,monica,"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.",8.1

S06E11,joey,You’re right! That did cheer me up!,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.",8.1

S06E12,ross,"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.",8.1

S06E12,monica,"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Yeah, I guess.",8.1
S06E12,joey,Hey guys.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.",8.1

S06E12,chandler,"Joey, why is your cable out?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,Whoa ho.,8.1

S06E12,monica,"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",8.1
S06E12,rachel,I don’t know.,8.1
S06E12,monica,Me neither.,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,Rachel.,8.1
S06E12,monica,What?!,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,I don’t know.  Me neither.,8.1
S06E12,joey,You forget how many great songs Heart had.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Yeah.,8.1
S06E12,ross,"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",8.1
S06E12,chandler,Yeah!,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .",8.1
S06E12,chandler,Okay .,8.1
S06E12,joey,"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",8.1
S06E12,joey,What?!,8.1
S06E12,joey,Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,8.1
S06E12,monica,"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"He took my joke, he took it.",8.1
S06E12,monica,It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",8.1
S06E12,monica,That’s a good idea.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Yeah!,8.1
S06E12,monica,Do you know what’s a bad idea?,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Picking Rachel.,8.1
S06E12,monica,That’s right.  Did you hear something?,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,8.1
S06E12,monica,It’s coming from the living room.,8.1
S06E12,joey,NA,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Hey, you guys.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,I guess it was kinda funny.,8.1
S06E12,monica,It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!,8.1
S06E12,monica,"That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Well, people are different.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Oh, okay,  you’re not a pushover.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch.",8.1
S06E12,monica,NA,8.1
S06E12,rachel,I cannot believe her.,8.1
S06E12,monica,I know. Where do you wanna go eat?,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",8.1
S06E12,monica,I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",8.1
S06E12,monica,All right.,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",8.1
S06E12,joey,Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,No.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"No, thank you.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",8.1
S06E12,joey,You got it.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Joey, what are you doing?",8.1
S06E12,joey,Just being friendly.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Joey, do you work here?",8.1
S06E12,joey,No.,8.1
S06E12,joey,Yeah?,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.,8.1
S06E12,joey,"I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"See, now it’s weird again.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,Okay.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",8.1
S06E12,monica,Hah!,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"That true, I am flaky.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Yeah, totally.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,That’s great. Good for you guys.,8.1
S06E12,monica,I am not high maintenance!,8.1
S06E12,rachel,I am not a pushover!,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,Who said you were?,8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",8.1
S06E12,joey,"No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"So, you’d hire me, right?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.",8.1
S06E12,ross,It’s my joke.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,It’s my joke.,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,Let’s have Monica decide.,8.1
S06E12,ross,Yeah!,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Yeah!,8.1
S06E12,ross,Hey Mon.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Mon, get out here!",8.1
S06E12,ross,Monica!,8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",8.1
S06E12,monica,Why do I have to decide?,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Because you’re the only one that can be fair.,8.1
S06E12,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S06E12,monica,I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.,8.1
S06E12,ross,"Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.",8.1
S06E12,ross,We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Okay, Chandler, you go first.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",8.1
S06E12,chandler,Can I finish my story?!,8.1
S06E12,monica,Do you want me to pick you?!,8.1
S06E12,ross,"See, I would never snap at you like that.",8.1
S06E12,monica,Continue.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.",8.1
S06E12,ross,"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!",8.1
S06E12,chandler,I’m not arguing with that.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",8.1
S06E12,ross,It’s your joke.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Is not.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Hi, Chandler. There you are.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Hi, oh hi.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",8.1
S06E12,chandler,—generosity of spirit.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,Really? I’ve heard better.,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",8.1
S06E12,chandler,You’re a little high maintenance.,8.1
S06E12,monica,Ahhh! You are on my list.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",8.1
S06E12,monica,. All right you’re off my list.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,NA,8.1
S06E12,monica,"Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,Wow! That is a bad audition.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,How-how did you lose your job here?,8.1
S06E12,joey,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.",8.1
S06E12,joey,"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him.  Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…",8.1
S06E12,rachel,What?,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",8.1
S06E12,joey,That’s great. Thanks Rach.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Rach, you’re in my seat.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",8.1
S06E12,monica,"I pick you, Phoebe.",8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",8.1
S06E12,phoebe,"Yeah, well, I kinda thought.",8.1
S06E12,chandler,Hey.,8.1
S06E12,rachel,"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",8.1
S06E12,ross,No way.,8.1
S06E12,joey,I’m not answering that.,8.1
S06E12,chandler,Joey!  No way. I’m not answering that.,8.1
S06E13,joey,"Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s  $12.75.",8.2
S06E13,chandler,This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.,8.2
S06E13,joey,Hi!,8.2
S06E13,joey,Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.,8.2
S06E13,joey,"Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him—He says it’s okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!",8.2
S06E13,ross,"Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?",8.2
S06E13,joey,It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,Yeah Joey that is so gross!,8.2
S06E13,joey,How about a scone on the house baby?,8.2
S06E13,phoebe,I’m pretty.,8.2
S06E13,ross,Hey does anyone have any gum?,8.2
S06E13,phoebe,Oh I do!  I know it’s in here somewhere.,8.2
S06E13,ross,Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!,8.2
S06E13,monica,Hey!,8.2
S06E13,ross,Hey!,8.2
S06E13,chandler,"Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?",8.2
S06E13,monica,"Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick.",8.2
S06E13,chandler,I’m so sorry you’re sick.,8.2
S06E13,monica,I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.",8.2
S06E13,monica,NA,8.2
S06E13,chandler,I’m gonna grab you some tissue.,8.2
S06E13,monica,I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!,8.2
S06E13,ross,When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.,8.2
S06E13,monica,"I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.",8.2
S06E13,chandler,Yes?,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Oh my God, Jill!",8.2
S06E13,chandler,"Oh my God, introduce us!",8.2
S06E13,rachel,This is Chandler.,8.2
S06E13,rachel,And you know Monica and Ross!,8.2
S06E13,ross,Hi Jill.,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey.",8.2
S06E13,joey,"Hey,  how you doin’?",8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Don’t!!  Honey, what are you doing here?!",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?,8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"Never mind, I got it.",8.2
S06E13,rachel,Wow! What did he say?,8.2
S06E13,rachel,Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.,8.2
S06E13,monica,Rach?,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?",8.2
S06E13,monica,You bought a boat?,8.2
S06E13,chandler,Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"Of course, yeah!",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"Ooh, I like cards.",8.2
S06E13,joey,Are you all finished here?,8.2
S06E13,joey,Great!,8.2
S06E13,joey,What?!,8.2
S06E13,joey,"Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?",8.2
S06E13,joey,"Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?",8.2
S06E13,joey,NA,8.2
S06E13,ross,"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.",8.2
S06E13,ross,I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.,8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,I would love that job!,8.2
S06E13,rachel,Hey! What’s goin’ on?,8.2
S06E13,rachel,Jill! Did you shop?!,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,Sorry Jill.,8.2
S06E13,ross,Sorry-sorry Jill.,8.2

S06E13,rachel,Apartment pants?,8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"Yeah, you never heard of them?",8.2
S06E13,rachel,"No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get?",8.2
S06E13,ross,"Huh? Oh, I got this——this!",8.2
S06E13,rachel,A pajmena?,8.2
S06E13,ross,"Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!",8.2
S06E13,rachel,Really?,8.2
S06E13,ross,"Ross, wants a pajmena?",8.2
S06E13,ross,It’s a rug.,8.2
S06E13,rachel,Jill?,8.2
S06E13,rachel,"Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!",8.2
S06E13,rachel,"All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena.",8.2
S06E13,ross,"Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.",8.2
S06E13,ross,Well. Hey…,8.2
S06E13,ross,"Oh yeah, how about you and the,  \I’m sorry!\""",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?",8.2
S06E13,ross,Oh stop.,8.2
S06E13,ross,"No, you stop!",8.2
S06E13,phoebe,"Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!",8.2
S06E13,monica,"Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!",8.2
S06E13,chandler,"I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids.",8.2
S06E13,monica,"Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.",8.2
S06E13,chandler,That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here.,8.2
S06E13,monica,NA,8.2

S06E14,ross,So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!,8.6
S06E14,rachel,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",8.6
S06E14,ross,"Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.",8.6
S06E14,phoebe,Hey!,8.6
S06E14,joey,Hey!,8.6
S06E14,phoebe,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.",8.6
S06E14,joey,"Oh no, not you too!",8.6
S06E14,phoebe,No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.,8.6
S06E14,joey,Nice!,8.6
S06E14,phoebe,"Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.",8.6
S06E14,joey,"That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?",8.6
S06E14,phoebe,Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.,8.6
S06E14,joey,You do?,8.6
S06E14,phoebe,Yeah.  See?,8.6
S06E14,joey,Yeah.,8.6
S06E14,chandler,Hey.,8.6
S06E14,ross,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",8.6
S06E14,rachel,Oh! I knew it! What happened?,8.6
S06E14,ross,"Umm, she kissed me.",8.6
S06E14,rachel,What?! You kissed!,8.6
S06E14,chandler,Maybe we should give them some privacy.,8.6
S06E14,monica,Shhhh!!!,8.6
S06E14,ross,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",8.6
S06E14,rachel,"Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",8.6
S06E14,ross,"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…",8.6
S06E14,rachel,Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about!,8.6
S06E14,ross,Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.,8.6
S06E14,rachel,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.",8.6
S06E14,ross,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!,8.6
S06E14,rachel,What?!,8.6
S06E14,ross,"No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.",8.6
S06E14,rachel,"Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you.",8.6
S06E14,ross,You’re welcome.,8.6
S06E14,monica,Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,8.6
S06E14,chandler,I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!,8.6
S06E14,rachel,"Yeah, I got that.",8.6
S06E14,ross,You take care Jill.,8.6
S06E14,rachel,Bye-bye-e!,8.6
S06E14,monica,Bye.,8.6
S06E14,chandler,"I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",8.6
S06E15,rachel,"Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!",8.5
S06E15,monica,Oh my God!,8.5
S06E15,phoebe,Wow!,8.5
S06E15,joey,What is the matter with you?!,8.5
S06E15,phoebe,No! Barry and Mindy.,8.5
S06E15,joey,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?",8.5
S06E15,rachel,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.,8.5
S06E15,joey,"Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?",8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",8.5
S06E15,monica,Why did they get divorced?,8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",8.5
S06E15,ross,"I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.",8.5
S06E15,phoebe,Which time?,8.5
S06E15,ross,"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.",8.5
S06E15,joey,I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.,8.5
S06E15,ross,"I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.",8.5
S06E15,chandler,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.,8.5
S06E15,monica,"And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.",8.5
S06E15,chandler,Sure I would!,8.5
S06E15,chandler,"What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?",8.5
S06E15,ross,"No, I just think Monica was that fat.",8.5
S06E15,joey,"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!",8.5
S06E15,chandler,"What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.",8.5
S06E15,phoebe,What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?,8.5
S06E15,ross,What?!,8.5
S06E15,rachel,Merrill Lynch?,8.5
S06E15,phoebe,"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",8.5
S06E15,rachel,Well why didn’t you take the job?,8.5
S06E15,phoebe,"Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.",8.5
S06E15,ross,"Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?",8.5
S06E15,ross,Oh my God! Rachel Green?,8.5
S06E15,rachel,Rob Tillman!,8.5
S06E15,ross,"No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!",8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.",8.5
S06E15,ross,"No, no-no, Ross Geller.",8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!",8.5
S06E15,ross,Yeah. Right.,8.5
S06E15,rachel,Wow! How are you?!,8.5
S06E15,ross,"Good-good, I’m-I’m married.",8.5
S06E15,rachel,Ohh! Me too!,8.5
S06E15,ross,Is-isn’t it the best?,8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Oh, it’s the best!  So, umm how’s Monica?",8.5
S06E15,ross,"Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.",8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Ohh, I would love too.",8.5
S06E15,ross,"Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!",8.5
S06E15,rachel,Ohh! Okay!,8.5
S06E15,ross,Come on!,8.5
S06E15,rachel,"Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?",8.5
S06E15,ross,"No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…",8.5
S06E15,rachel,Oh yeah? Okay.,8.5
S06E15,ross,Okay.,8.5
S06E15,rachel,But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?,8.5
S06E15,ross,"Uh-huh.  Okay, let’s go see Monica!",8.5
S06E15,joey,"So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?",8.5
S06E15,monica,He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.,8.5
S06E15,monica,Thanks.,8.5

S06E15,monica,Okay.,8.5
S06E15,monica,Bye.,8.5
S06E15,chandler,Was his question what’s more boring than him?,8.5
S06E15,joey,"Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?",8.5
S06E15,chandler,"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.",8.5
S06E15,joey,Really?,8.5
S06E15,chandler,Ehh.,8.5
S06E15,monica,"Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?",8.5
S06E15,joey,"That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?",8.5
S06E15,monica,"No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",8.5
S06E15,joey,That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!,8.5
S06E15,chandler,I could use the money; it could give me time to write.,8.5
S06E15,joey,Oh right great! Welcome aboard!,8.5
S06E15,chandler,Okay!,8.5
S06E15,joey,"All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!",8.5
S06E15,chandler,All right!,8.5
S06E15,phoebe,Hey!,8.5
S06E15,monica,Hey Phoebe! Guess what?,8.5

S06E15,ross,"Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!",8.5

S06E15,monica,"Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.",8.5

S06E15,phoebe,"Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!",8.5
S06E15,chandler,"Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.",8.5
S06E15,phoebe,"I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?",8.5

S06E15,rachel,"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",8.5
S06E15,joey,"It’s uh, right through there.",8.5

S06E15,monica,Really?,8.5
S06E15,chandler,"Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me.

S06E15,monica,Chandler!,8.5
S06E15,chandler,"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a \doctor…\""",8.5

S06E17,ross,Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!,9.1
S06E17,phoebe,Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.,9.1
S06E17,ross,Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!,9.1
S06E17,phoebe,You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?,9.1
S06E17,ross,surprise!!,9.1
S06E17,ross,"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.",9.1
S06E17,rachel,"Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.",9.1

S06E18,monica,So it’s okay to date a student.,8.3
S06E18,ross,"Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",8.3

S06E18,ross,"What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?",8.3
S06E18,ross,"What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.",8.3

S06E19,chandler,"Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?",8.3
S06E19,ross,What’s-what’s the difference?,8.3

S06E19,chandler,"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?",8.3
S06E19,phoebe,"Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? \Hey Sebastian",8.3
S06E19,monica,"All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.",8.3

S06E19,joey,"Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?",8.3

S06E21,rachel,Oh. We?,8.6
S06E21,rachel,"Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’",8.6

S06E21,chandler,"Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!",8.6
S06E21,joey,"Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!",8.6
S06E21,phoebe,"Well, why don’t you just get him fired?",8.6
S06E21,joey,"I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.  Joey Tribbiani.",8.6

S06E21,ross,How is that important?,8.6
S06E21,rachel,Oh it’s important!,8.6
S06E21,joey,"Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?",8.6
S06E21,monica,"Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.",8.6
S06E21,joey,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.",8.6
S06E21,monica,"No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!",8.6
S06E21,joey,"That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.",8.6
S06E21,chandler,"So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?",8.6
S06E21,monica,Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,8.6

S06E21,rachel,Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.,8.6
S06E21,ross,"Yeah, take your time.",8.6

S06E21,rachel,"Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!",8.6
S06E21,monica,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",8.6
S06E21,chandler,We said seven!,8.6
S06E21,monica,We said six!,8.6
S06E21,chandler,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",8.6
S06E21,monica,"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, \Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!\""",8.6
S06E21,phoebe,Hi!,8.6
S06E21,chandler,Oh my good God.,8.6
S06E21,monica,Ugh!,8.6

S06E21,chandler,"Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.",8.6
S06E21,joey,"Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you——You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.",8.6
S06E21,rachel,"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.",8.6
S06E21,rachel,"Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.",8.6
S06E21,ross,"Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…",8.6
S06E21,ross,God no!,8.6
S06E21,ross,"Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me!  Still not yelling!",8.6

S06E21,rachel,"Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!",8.6
S06E21,ross,"That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.",8.6
S06E21,rachel,Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!,8.6
S06E21,joey,"Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.",8.6
S06E21,joey,"You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!",8.6
S06E22,phoebe,"Hi, you guys.",9
S06E22,chandler,Hey!,9
S06E22,monica,Hi!,9
S06E22,rachel,What’s the matter?,9
S06E22,phoebe,Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.,9
S06E22,joey,Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.,9
S06E22,phoebe,No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!,9
S06E22,chandler,I’ll give up my ticket.,9
S06E22,joey,Me too.,9
S06E22,phoebe,Okay that’s so generous!,9
S06E22,chandler,And I think Ross is generous too.,9
S06E22,phoebe,Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!,9
S06E22,phoebe,Yeah.,9
S06E22,rachel,So what-what is the exhibit.,9
S06E22,phoebe,It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.,9
S06E22,joey,Oh man!,9
S06E22,ross,Hey!,9
S06E22,rachel,Hi!,9
S06E22,chandler,Hey!,9
S06E22,joey,Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!,9
S06E22,ross,Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.,9
S06E22,monica,Oh that’s great!,9
S06E22,ross,Yeah.,9
S06E22,monica,I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!,9
S06E22,ross,Why? What?,9
S06E22,monica,"Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",9
S06E22,ross,"No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?",9
S06E22,rachel,I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.,9
S06E22,ross,"Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.",9
S06E22,chandler,Ross.,9
S06E22,ross,"Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…",9
S06E22,ross,"Really? That okay, that’s great.",9
S06E22,ross,"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.",9
S06E22,ross,"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.",9
S06E22,ross,Ohh! A man with a plan!,9
S06E22,phoebe,"Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!",9
S06E22,joey,"I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…",9
S06E22,phoebe,Yeah I know; we’d be great together!,9
S06E22,joey,Hey! So I’m back.,9
S06E22,joey,"Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.",9
S06E22,joey,"Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",9
S06E22,joey,"Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?",9
S06E22,phoebe,"So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?",9
S06E22,monica,"Oh, I love museums!",9
S06E22,rachel,Umm.,9
S06E22,monica,Soakin’ up all the culture.,9
S06E22,rachel,Yeah.,9
S06E22,monica,Where do you want to start?,9
S06E22,rachel,"Ooh, the gift shop!",9
S06E22,monica,Yeah!,9
S06E22,phoebe,"Hey, and then lunch.",9
S06E22,rachel,"Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",9
S06E22,phoebe,"Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?",9
S06E22,rachel,What?! No! Why?!,9
S06E22,phoebe,"No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",9
S06E22,rachel,I didn’t know you could get married here.,9
S06E22,monica,"This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!",9
S06E22,rachel,Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?,9
S06E22,rachel,"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",9
S06E22,monica,What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.,9
S06E22,phoebe,"Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.",9
S06E22,rachel,"Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.",9
S06E22,monica,"Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",9
S06E22,rachel,I’m gonna do it too!,9
S06E22,phoebe,Me too!,9
S06E22,rachel,"Really? Who would, who would you marry?",9
S06E22,phoebe,"I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?",9
S06E22,rachel,Oh Pheebs.,9
S06E22,phoebe,Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.,9
S06E22,monica,"Phoebe, that stuff is…",9
S06E22,phoebe,Don’t even get me started on yours!,9

S06E22,ross,"Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?",9
S06E22,ross,"Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.",9
S06E22,ross,"No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.",9

S06E22,rachel,Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?,9
S06E22,rachel,"Well, why do y’know go in that room  and do your homework?",9
S06E22,rachel,"That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom.  That’s your dad’s bedroom!",9
S06E22,rachel,"Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!",9
S06E22,monica,"Hi, honey.",9

S06E22,chandler,NA,9
S06E22,monica,NOOOO!!!!!!!!,9
S06E22,joey,"Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",9
S06E22,joey,"Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.",9
S06E22,joey,"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?",9
S06E22,rachel,"Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs.  If-if you get me something from the car.",9

S06E22,monica,Phoebe!,9
S06E22,phoebe,Yeah?,9
S06E22,monica,Have you seen Chandler?!,9
S06E22,phoebe,No! Why?,9
S06E22,monica,The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!  I know! How bad is this?!,9
S06E22,phoebe,"Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!",9
S06E22,monica,I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!,9
S06E22,phoebe,What are you gonna do?,9
S06E22,monica,"Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!  \Y’know",9
S06E22,phoebe,Rachel said that!,9
S06E22,monica,Well Rachel’s not here!,9
S06E22,phoebe,Oh! Here it is!,9
S06E22,joey,I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!,9
S06E22,phoebe,"Okay, maybe ask this guy.",9
S06E22,phoebe,"Well, what did he do?",9
S06E22,phoebe,Joey!,9
S06E22,joey,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!",9
S06E22,phoebe,"Well, we should go.",9
S06E22,joey,Yeah.,9
S06E22,ross,"Elizabeth!  I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?",9
S06E22,rachel,Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!,9
S06E22,rachel,Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?,9
S06E22,ross,And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.,9
S06E22,ross,"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…",9
S06E22,ross,"All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.",9
S06E22,ross,And I too am just a love machine.,9
S06E22,monica,"I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",9
S06E22,chandler,"I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.",9
S06E22,monica,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?",9
S06E22,chandler,Right here!,9
S06E22,monica,"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…",9
S06E22,chandler,"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",9
S06E22,monica,"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",9
S06E22,chandler,Okay.,9
S06E22,monica,Really?,9
S06E22,chandler,"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…",9
S06E22,monica,I know! I know.,9
S06E22,chandler,Okay.,9
S06E22,monica,I’m gonna go tell Joey that,9
S06E22,phoebe,"Hey, did she buy it?",9
S06E22,chandler,Totally.,9
S06E22,phoebe,So did Heldi show you the place?,9
S06E22,chandler,"Yeah, it’s beautiful.",9
S06E22,phoebe,I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!,9
S06E22,chandler,I know.,9
S06E22,joey,Hey Gunther.,9
S06E22,joey,"Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.",9
S06E22,joey,"No! No, I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.",9
S06E22,joey,Great!,9
S06E23,chandler,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Now, have you told anyone else?",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,You told me.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Me too.,8.6
S06E23,joey,Hey.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,Hey.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Oh all right.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Yeah, coffeehouse.",8.6
S06E23,ross,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.",8.6
S06E23,ross,How rude.,8.6
S06E23,joey,"Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,So how are things going with Paul?,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,Hi!,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Watch this.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,Okay.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Hi Paul!,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,So how are things going with you?,8.6
S06E23,rachel,Okay.,8.6
S06E23,ross,Hi!,8.6
S06E23,ross,Great to see you!,8.6
S06E23,ross,How you doing?,8.6
S06E23,ross,Okay! You take care!,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?",8.6
S06E23,ross,"Phoebe, why’d you do it?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!,8.6
S06E23,ross,What?! Why?!,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Please, I think you know why.",8.6
S06E23,ross,I can’t think of anything.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",8.6
S06E23,ross,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?,8.6
S06E23,ross,I guess it could.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Well then I think that’s it.,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what——Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",8.6
S06E23,rachel,Okay.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,All right.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,Hm-mmm.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,Oh!,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",8.6
S06E23,rachel,What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring.  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Or not, whatever.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Chandler, I-I will handle this!  How much is it?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,We will give you $10.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,We stand firm at $10.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Uh, credit card.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Okay.  Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,I’ll give you $1 for them.,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",8.6
S06E23,joey,No.,8.6
S06E23,ross,Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,8.6
S06E23,joey,Yeah.,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",8.6
S06E23,joey,"Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",8.6
S06E23,ross,"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",8.6
S06E23,joey,Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,8.6
S06E23,ross,Oh.,8.6
S06E23,joey,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.",8.6
S06E23,ross,All the time?,8.6
S06E23,joey,All the time!,8.6
S06E23,rachel,Oh my God! Oh my God!!,8.6
S06E23,monica,Still crying?,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!",8.6
S06E23,monica,"Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,What’s the other one?,8.6
S06E23,monica,"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Oh that’s right. You’re the talker.  Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",8.6
S06E23,monica,"Oh, we have some…",8.6
S06E23,rachel,No you don’t!,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara.  What do you think, too much?",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.  Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Oh my God!!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,No. How are ya Paul?,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"No, did he hug you?!",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Yeah?,8.6
S06E23,chandler,I’m a little busy here Paul.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Okay!,8.6
S06E23,joey,Hey!,8.6
S06E23,joey,Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,Do you have my credit card?,8.6
S06E23,joey,"Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket.  My back pocket! My back pocket!",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Thank God!,8.6
S06E23,joey,Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Oh, I can’t go.",8.6
S06E23,joey,"Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!",8.6
S06E23,chandler,What?,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,They put you in jail?,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,The little jail between the doors!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Maybe it was the guy.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,It was the ring!,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?",8.6
S06E23,joey,No! He blew us off!,8.6
S06E23,ross,What?!,8.6
S06E23,joey,I know!,8.6
S06E23,ross,I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.,8.6
S06E23,joey,Can I tell you something? Me too.,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!",8.6
S06E23,joey,Ooooh! Freeze him out.,8.6
S06E23,ross,That’s right!,8.6
S06E23,joey,I like it!,8.6
S06E23,ross,Eh? We’ll show him!,8.6
S06E23,joey,"From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.  Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,Hi. I’m back.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Ah that’s great. No actually that’s…  That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.",8.6
S06E23,rachel,A lover?,8.6
S06E23,rachel,Oh yeah surfer?,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh,  get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?",8.6
S06E23,rachel,"I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",8.6
S06E23,rachel,Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.,8.6
S06E23,rachel,"I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Hey.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,"No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,I can’t do that.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,There he is!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Oh, okay.  Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,It is your office.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,John?,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Here he is.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,Ew.,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,Wow! I would trade.,8.6
S06E23,chandler,No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?,8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.",8.6
S06E23,phoebe,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Okay, that’s enough honey!",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Great! Okay, here.",8.6
S06E23,chandler,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!,8.6
S06E23,chandler,Guys?  I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.,8.6
S06E23,joey,I think we gotta end the freeze out.,8.6
S06E23,ross,"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?",8.6
S06E23,chandler,"Yeah, check out the ring.",8.6
S06E23,joey,Oh my God!!,8.6

S06E24,rachel,"Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",8.8
S06E24,monica,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?",8.8
S06E24,chandler,"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!",8.8
S06E24,monica,"Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!",8.8
S06E24,chandler,"If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",8.8
S06E24,monica,Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,8.8
S06E24,chandler,"Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.",8.8
S06E24,monica,Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!,8.8
S06E24,monica,Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,"It’s okay, I got a plan.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,We’re gonna find love!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,Definitely!,8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",8.8
S06E24,phoebe,What do you mean?,8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.",8.8
S06E24,phoebe,You mean a backup?,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Exactly!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Yeah, yeah I got that.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,You do?,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,Hm-mmm.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Who?,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,Joey.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Joey?!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,Yeah!,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Are you serious?!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!",8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.",8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Oh, seriously?",8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were…",8.8
S06E24,rachel,Charming.,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Well hey, it’s just a backup.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,Yeah.,8.8
S06E24,joey,Hey Monica!,8.8
S06E24,monica,Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,8.8
S06E24,joey,"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",8.8
S06E24,monica,"Yeah, it’s great.",8.8
S06E24,joey,"Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!",8.8
S06E24,monica,I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!,8.8
S06E24,joey,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,8.8
S06E24,monica,"It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!",8.8
S06E24,joey,"Well, you know Chandler.",8.8
S06E24,monica,No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.,8.8
S06E24,joey,Maybe you changed?,8.8
S06E24,monica,I didn’t change!,8.8
S06E24,joey,Maybe that’s the problem.,8.8
S06E24,monica,What?!,8.8
S06E24,joey,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",8.8
S06E24,monica,Is that some kind of boat talk?,8.8
S06E24,joey,I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.,8.8
S06E24,monica,What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?,8.8
S06E24,joey,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",8.8
S06E24,monica,Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,8.8
S06E24,joey,There are?,8.8
S06E24,monica,Yeah! Richard!,8.8
S06E24,joey,R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!,8.8
S06E24,monica,That’s right.,8.8
S06E24,joey,Chandler loves marriage!!,8.8
S06E24,monica,You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!,8.8
S06E24,joey,You got that from what I said?!,8.8
S06E24,ross,What happened you guys?,8.8
S06E24,ross,Rach!,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Hey you!,8.8
S06E24,ross,"Hey, come on in.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",8.8
S06E24,ross,"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",8.8
S06E24,ross,I guess so.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, \What’s that?!\""",8.8
S06E24,ross,Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Exactly.,8.8
S06E24,ross,"Ohh, yeah I already have one.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,What? Who?,8.8
S06E24,ross,Phoebe.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",8.8
S06E24,ross,"Ohh, I don’t think so.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",8.8
S06E24,ross,"That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",8.8
S06E24,joey,Where the hell have you been?!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,8.8
S06E24,joey,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,What?!,8.8
S06E24,joey,"Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!",8.8
S06E24,chandler,My—Oh my God!,8.8
S06E24,joey,I know! They suck!!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!,8.8
S06E24,joey,I know!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!,8.8
S06E24,joey,"Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",8.8
S06E24,chandler,You’re right.,8.8
S06E24,joey,Yeah!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Okay.  I’m just going to propose!,8.8
S06E24,joey,Okay.,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Okay great.,8.8
S06E24,joey,Dude-dude-dude!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,What?!,8.8
S06E24,joey,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",8.8
S06E24,monica,Hi.,8.8
S06E24,monica,I don’t know why I’m here.,8.8
S06E24,monica,I don’t know.,8.8
S06E24,monica,Chandler is such an idiot!,8.8
S06E24,monica,"Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…",8.8
S06E24,monica,Still smoking cigars?,8.8
S06E24,monica,"No that’s, that’s okay.",8.8
S06E24,monica,"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",8.8
S06E24,monica,Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.,8.8
S06E24,monica,Edward Nevski?,8.8
S06E24,monica,No.,8.8
S06E24,monica,But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!",8.8
S06E24,rachel,What?!,8.8
S06E24,joey,Hey!,8.8
S06E24,ross,Hey!,8.8
S06E24,joey,Phoebe! We’re both  your backup?!,8.8

S06E24,phoebe,I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,8.8
S06E24,joey,No we weren’t!,8.8
S06E24,ross,I was not!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!",8.8
S06E24,rachel,Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!,8.8
S06E24,joey,Pick me!!,8.8
S06E24,ross,No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!,8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!",8.8
S06E24,joey,"This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",8.8
S06E24,ross,"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!",8.8
S06E24,phoebe,"No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Oh God, Phoebe!",8.8
S06E24,phoebe,I’m talking about massages.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,Oh.,8.8
S06E24,rachel,"Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",8.8

S06E24,monica,"I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!",8.8
S06E24,monica,Oh!  Him.,8.8
S06E24,monica,"I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!",8.8
S06E24,monica,"Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!",8.8
S06E24,monica,"Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",8.8
S06E24,monica,Nothing.  I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…,8.8

S06E24,chandler,"Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.",8.8
S06E24,chandler,Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,And what does she have to think about? I love her!,8.8
S06E24,chandler,"But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!",8.8
S06E24,chandler,"It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight.",8.8
S06E24,chandler,Yeah I even  Did you get a ring?,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.,8.8

S06E24,chandler,What are you talking about?,8.8
S06E24,joey,"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.",8.8
S06E24,chandler,Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!,8.8
S06E24,joey,"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.",8.8
S06E24,chandler,Well where… Where did she go?,8.8
S06E24,joey,To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.,8.8
S06E24,chandler,I can’t believe I ruined this.,8.8
S06E24,joey,I am so sorry man.,8.8
S06E24,monica,You wanted it to be a surprise.,8.8
S06E24,chandler,Oh my God.,8.8

S07E01,monica,"Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?",8.4
S07E01,rachel,What?,8.4
S07E01,monica,"See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Oh honey, but it is just about…",8.4
S07E01,ross,It is! It is!,8.4
S07E01,monica,No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!,8.4

S07E01,rachel,No!,8.4
S07E01,ross,Oh no!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"No-no, it’s really not huge.",8.4
S07E01,ross,And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!,8.4
S07E01,monica,"Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.",8.4

S07E01,chandler,"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!",8.4
S07E01,joey,I’m 30!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Joey, you are not! You’re 31.",8.4
S07E01,joey,Aww crap!,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s,  maybe no more for you though.",8.4
S07E01,monica,"Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,Why?!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…",8.4

S07E01,phoebe,"Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.",8.4
S07E01,joey,Wouldn’t she?,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,Would she?,8.4
S07E01,joey,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!,8.4
S07E01,ross,Guess who?,8.4
S07E01,rachel,Hey.,8.4
S07E01,ross,"Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.",8.4
S07E01,ross,Still thinking about it huh?,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you!",8.4
S07E01,ross,"Oh, who cares?",8.4

S07E01,ross,Okay. Sure.,8.4
S07E01,rachel,Am I going to let you watch me undress?,8.4
S07E01,ross,NA,8.4
S07E01,monica,"I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.",8.4
S07E01,monica,Paris?,8.4
S07E01,chandler,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .,8.4
S07E01,monica,Keep talking.,8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!",8.4
S07E01,monica,I love you!,8.4
S07E01,monica,"Bonjour, monsieur.",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!",8.4
S07E01,monica,NA,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.",8.4
S07E01,monica,What?!,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Oh, I see.",8.4
S07E01,joey,"They break your heart, don’t they?",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Y’know, I don’t really their permission.",8.4
S07E01,joey,"Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.",8.4
S07E01,joey,What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.,8.4
S07E01,joey,And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,Maybe just 10 minutes for you.,8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!",8.4
S07E01,monica,Yes.,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?",8.4
S07E01,monica,"Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,What?!,8.4
S07E01,ross,"Hey, here’s a thought.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Monica, what are you talking about?",8.4
S07E01,monica,"My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Ahh, third base.",8.4
S07E01,monica,It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!",8.4
S07E01,monica,We had a characturist!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,Oh!!,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,NA,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.",8.4
S07E01,monica,"And yet, here we are doing it again.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!",8.4
S07E01,monica,Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!,8.4
S07E01,ross,Got me.,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!",8.4
S07E01,monica,I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!",8.4
S07E01,monica,"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!",8.4
S07E01,ross,"Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.",8.4
S07E01,chandler,Why to save your dignity my man.,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?",8.4
S07E01,monica,"I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!",8.4
S07E01,monica,I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!!,8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Well, somebody should.",8.4
S07E01,ross,"Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.",8.4
S07E01,ross,"Oh, I see, so everybody wins.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,Who is it?,8.4
S07E01,monica,"It’s Monica, open up!",8.4
S07E01,rachel,Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!,8.4
S07E01,ross,Oww!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Yeah, you like that baby?  May we help you?",8.4
S07E01,monica,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!",8.4
S07E01,chandler,How is that ever going to happen?!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!",8.4
S07E01,monica,I know why!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,No you don’t know why!,8.4
S07E01,monica,Okay! Why?!,8.4
S07E01,rachel,Because! Because I was sad.,8.4
S07E01,monica,What do you mean?,8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!",8.4
S07E01,chandler,"I don’t care, she slept with me.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,"Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.",8.4
S07E01,monica,NA,8.4
S07E01,ross,Congratulations man.,8.4
S07E01,chandler,Thanks.,8.4
S07E01,ross,"And uh, Rachel.",8.4
S07E01,rachel,Yeah.,8.4
S07E01,ross,"What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,NA,8.4
S07E01,chandler,"Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.",8.4
S07E01,phoebe,Oh thank you.,8.4
S07E01,chandler,Okay.,8.4
S07E01,phoebe,"Now… —Oh—oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning.",8.4
S07E02,joey,Hey!,8.3
S07E02,ross,Hi!,8.3
S07E02,joey,Who wants French toast?,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Oh, I’ll have some!",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.",8.3
S07E02,monica,Oww!,8.3
S07E02,chandler,What’s the matter honey?,8.3
S07E02,monica,"I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged!  How long before it starts getting annoying?",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,It starts?,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!",8.3
S07E02,monica,Okay!,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Already?!,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Oh, I got some thoughts on that.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.",8.3
S07E02,monica,NA,8.3
S07E02,chandler,What in God’s name is that?!,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!",8.3
S07E02,monica,"This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.  First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,That is so smart!  Break it off. Break it off now.,8.3
S07E02,ross,And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at…,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,Hey! Ross!,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Wh-what’s going on?",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,Nothing—Why?!,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.,8.3
S07E02,ross,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",8.3
S07E02,monica,"All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,Aw.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick…  And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Y’know, something a little snugglyer?",8.3
S07E02,chandler,Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Well, the duck…",8.3
S07E02,rachel,What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",8.3
S07E02,monica,"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",8.3
S07E02,chandler,Okay.,8.3
S07E02,monica,Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Centerpieces!,8.3
S07E02,monica,Yeah! Roses or Lilies?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Definitely roses.  But Lilies are the clear choice.,8.3
S07E02,monica,Oh my God! It’s like one mind.,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Uh-huh!,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!",8.3
S07E02,rachel,What?!,8.3
S07E02,joey,"All right, I’m gonna go!",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",8.3
S07E02,joey,I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling?",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Uh, Phoebe…",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Oh Ross, hi.",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Phoebe, what are you doing?",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.",8.3
S07E02,ross,Phoebe!,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Okay, let’s talk outside.",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!,8.3
S07E02,ross,And they knew about it?,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!",8.3
S07E02,ross,"The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?",8.3
S07E02,joey,Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?,8.3
S07E02,rachel,No.,8.3
S07E02,joey,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Joey, did you my face cream?",8.3
S07E02,joey,Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Joey,  where did you learn that word?",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Where do you think,  Zelda?",8.3
S07E02,rachel,You found my book?!,8.3
S07E02,joey,Yeah I did!,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",8.3
S07E02,joey,You got porn!,8.3
S07E02,ross,Hello.,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Can I, can I help you with something?",8.3
S07E02,ross,Yes I am.,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.",8.3
S07E02,monica,"Oh dad, really you don’t need to…",8.3
S07E02,chandler,What a sweet story.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.",8.3
S07E02,monica,"Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.  What?",8.3
S07E02,monica,What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?,8.3
S07E02,monica,I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,8.3
S07E02,monica,You bought the beach house when I was 23!,8.3
S07E02,monica,What about when I started dating Chandler?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.,8.3
S07E02,monica,I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you.",8.3
S07E02,monica,I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,Well what happened at dinner?,8.3
S07E02,monica,My parents spent the money for our wedding!,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,My God! What did you order?!,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Honey, it’s gonna be okay.",8.3
S07E02,monica,No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,Do you even understand what off the rack means?!,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?",8.3
S07E02,monica,How? I don’t have any money.,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Well, I have some.",8.3
S07E02,monica,How much?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Well, close to…",8.3
S07E02,monica,Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!,8.3
S07E02,rachel,Well what?! How-how much is it?!,8.3
S07E02,monica,It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.,8.3
S07E02,rachel,Ohh!  Really?!,8.3
S07E02,monica,"How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Hello, Mr. Chandler.",8.3
S07E02,monica,This is the most special day of our lives.,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.",8.3
S07E02,monica,"Honey, umm I-I love you,  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.",8.3
S07E02,monica,You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?,8.3

S07E02,joey,"No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Well no, I don’t smell anything.",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?",8.3
S07E02,rachel,Nothing!,8.3
S07E02,ross,NA,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!",8.3
S07E02,ross,So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?,8.3

S07E02,ross,‘Sup?,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!,8.3
S07E02,ross,I’m sorry?,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.",8.3
S07E02,ross,I gave him an extremely professional massage!,8.3
S07E02,phoebe,He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.,8.3
S07E02,ross,"Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!",8.3
S07E02,ross,"Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.",8.3
S07E02,phoebe,"Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!",8.3
S07E02,ross,"He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.",8.3
S07E02,joey,"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?",8.3
S07E02,ross,His daughter was hot.,8.3
S07E02,joey,Gotcha.,8.3
S07E02,monica,Hey.,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Hey.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,Ehh.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"Eh, you work for that.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",8.3
S07E02,monica,You do?!,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.",8.3
S07E02,monica,"Oh, you’re so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",8.3
S07E02,monica,You thought about that?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,Yeah.,8.3
S07E02,monica,How many kids were we gonna have?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",8.3
S07E02,monica,What else did you think about?,8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",8.3
S07E02,monica,"Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,Sure you do.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,You sure?,8.3
S07E02,monica,Uh-hmm.,8.3
S07E02,chandler,I love you so much.,8.3
S07E02,monica,"I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.",8.3
S07E02,chandler,"Oh yeah, totally!",8.3
S07E02,monica,Oh good.,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Hello, Zelda.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,Who are you supposed to be?,8.3
S07E02,joey,The vicar!,8.3
S07E02,rachel,Do you even know what a vicar is?,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Like a goalie, right?",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!",8.3
S07E02,joey,"All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!,8.3
S07E02,joey,Huh?,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.",8.3
S07E02,joey,NA,8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!",8.3
S07E02,joey,This body?,8.3
S07E02,rachel,Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!,8.3
S07E02,joey,"Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.",8.3
S07E02,rachel,"Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride!",8.3
S07E02,joey,"I don’t want to, I’m scared.",8.3
S07E03,chandler,"Hey, you guys!",8.1
S07E03,chandler,"So, what do you think?",8.1
S07E03,ross,About what?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Yeah, what?",8.1

S07E03,ross,"Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,No I didn’t!,8.1
S07E03,ross,Are you sure?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…",8.1
S07E03,joey,Feminine.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,Yes!,8.1
S07E03,chandler,No!,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,Really?,8.1
S07E03,monica,Yeah!,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"You didn’t think I used to wear glasses, right?",8.1
S07E03,monica,Of course!,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,So what do you guys want for an engagement present?,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…",8.1
S07E03,monica,"If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy.",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.",8.1
S07E03,monica,"Oh, I already have one.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.",8.1
S07E03,monica,"Hey, I know I what I want!",8.1
S07E03,chandler,What we want honey.,8.1
S07E03,monica,"No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Uh-huh, yeah.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Dying people say the craziest things.,8.1
S07E03,monica,I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"Break my heart—Oh, all right.",8.1
S07E03,monica,Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.,8.1
S07E03,joey,Ahoy!,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Hey! How’s the boat?!,8.1
S07E03,joey,Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?",8.1
S07E03,joey,Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",8.1
S07E03,joey,You could?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,Your own boat?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Do you know what I was thinkin’?,8.1
S07E03,monica,What?,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Nothing, I just like to go like this.",8.1
S07E03,ross,"Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?",8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Uh why, do you have a lecture?",8.1
S07E03,ross,"No, why?",8.1
S07E03,chandler,Then free as a bird. What’s up?,8.1
S07E03,ross,My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.",8.1
S07E03,ross,"Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Well, did-did you correct him?",8.1
S07E03,ross,"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.",8.1
S07E03,monica,"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S07E03,monica,He hates to lose.,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.",8.1
S07E03,ross,You’re not a lefty?,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Does anybody know me?!,8.1
S07E03,monica,What’s wrong Phoebe?,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!,8.1
S07E03,monica,No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.",8.1
S07E03,ross,"Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?",8.1
S07E03,chandler,Don’t worry about it Pheebs.,8.1
S07E03,ross,No one got me an engagement present.,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,An old cookie?,8.1
S07E03,monica,This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,We can’t accept this.,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,Why not?,8.1
S07E03,chandler,‘Cause it’s gross.,8.1
S07E03,monica,No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,Really?!,8.1
S07E03,monica,Yeah! I bet I can do it.,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Okay, we owe you a present.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Two! I’ve been engaged twice!,8.1
S07E03,joey,Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,That is the Coast Guard.,8.1
S07E03,joey,What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.",8.1
S07E03,joey,All right.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there  Yo-ho-ho!",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what’s this called?",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Uh, boat rope.",8.1
S07E03,rachel,Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?,8.1
S07E03,joey,"Uhh, rub it?",8.1
S07E03,rachel,No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?,8.1
S07E03,joey,"I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Time’s up, now your dead.",8.1
S07E03,joey,And deaf!,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!",8.1
S07E03,joey,Yes.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",8.1
S07E03,joey,I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.,8.1
S07E03,monica,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,You do?,8.1
S07E03,monica,"You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,That and arrogance.,8.1
S07E03,joey,Hey.,8.1
S07E03,monica,Hey! How was sailing?,8.1
S07E03,joey,"I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie.",8.1
S07E03,joey,NA,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.,8.1
S07E03,ross,Hey.,8.1
S07E03,monica,Hey! How was it?,8.1
S07E03,ross,"Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…",8.1
S07E03,chandler,I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.,8.1
S07E03,ross,And what did he ask you not to call him?,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Daddy. All right look, here’s the story.  So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,Guys?,8.1
S07E03,ross,Over here.,8.1
S07E03,monica,Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!,8.1
S07E03,chandler,I know.,8.1
S07E03,monica,You gave my father a lap dance!,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Why do they put so much steam in there?!,8.1
S07E03,ross,‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.,8.1
S07E03,chandler,Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"Come on, it’s not that big a deal!",8.1
S07E03,chandler,Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.,8.1
S07E03,ross,"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?",8.1
S07E03,monica,"Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!",8.1
S07E03,chandler,I don’t want him to tell this story for years.,8.1
S07E03,ross,"Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.",8.1
S07E03,monica,I wasn’t escaping.,8.1
S07E03,ross,Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?,8.1
S07E03,monica,I was trying to help out a squirrel.,8.1
S07E03,ross,You were trying to eat it!,8.1
S07E03,chandler,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!,8.1
S07E03,monica,NA,8.1
S07E03,chandler,"All right, I’m off to see your dad.",8.1
S07E03,ross,"Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.",8.1
S07E03,chandler,"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Thank you!,8.1
S07E03,joey,Hey.,8.1
S07E03,ross,Hey.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!",8.1
S07E03,rachel,Why not?,8.1
S07E03,joey,Because! You’re mean on the boat!,8.1
S07E03,rachel,What? I was just trying to teach you.,8.1
S07E03,joey,"Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!",8.1
S07E03,ross,Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",8.1
S07E03,ross,You have to respect the sea!,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Does a good teacher say, \Put down the beer pinhead!?\""",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",8.1
S07E03,joey,Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!",8.1
S07E03,joey,Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",8.1
S07E03,joey,You won’t boss me around anymore?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,I won’t boss you around.,8.1
S07E03,joey,And you’ll be nice?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"And, I’ll be nice.",8.1
S07E03,joey,And you’ll be topless?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,And—Joey!,8.1
S07E03,joey,Do you want me to learn?!,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Let’s give it a shot.,8.1
S07E03,monica,"Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",8.1
S07E03,monica,"No, just a Friday night.",8.1
S07E03,ross,"Ohh, these are pretty good.",8.1
S07E03,phoebe,"Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",8.1
S07E03,ross,Which one was that?,8.1
S07E03,monica,The ones we had right after you almost threw up.,8.1
S07E03,ross,Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I’m okay.,8.1
S07E03,phoebe,Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.,8.1
S07E03,ross,"Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh…",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?",8.1
S07E03,joey,Ohh yeah.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,Right?,8.1
S07E03,joey,Nope.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.",8.1
S07E03,joey,I don’t know why you just don’t say left.,8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Okay, go to the left.  The left!",8.1
S07E03,joey,Huh?,8.1
S07E03,rachel,NA,8.1
S07E03,joey,"Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side.",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"Joey, come on! We just went over this!",8.1
S07E03,joey,"Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",8.1
S07E03,rachel,"No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",8.1
S07E03,joey,All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!,8.1

S07E05,phoebe,"Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.",8.1
S07E05,ross,"Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!",8.1

S07E06,phoebe,Because I cared enough to lie!,8.9
S07E06,joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,What are you talking about?,8.9
S07E06,joey,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?",8.9
S07E06,joey,"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Well, it’s better than us deciding.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,No! Coins hate me!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.  Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.",8.9

S07E06,joey,"Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!",8.9
S07E06,ross,I… I don’t know what you are talking about.,8.9
S07E06,joey,Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,8.9
S07E06,ross,I’ve had better.,8.9
S07E06,joey,Okay! When?!,8.9
S07E06,ross,All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!,8.9
S07E06,joey,Uh-huh!,8.9
S07E06,ross,I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!,8.9
S07E06,joey,I want to do it again.,8.9
S07E06,ross,We can’t do it again.,8.9
S07E06,joey,Why not?,8.9
S07E06,ross,Because it’s weird!,8.9
S07E06,joey,Fine! Do you want something to drink?,8.9
S07E06,ross,"Sure, what do you got?",8.9
S07E06,joey,Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.,8.9
S07E06,monica,Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!,8.9
S07E06,chandler,Can you figure out what I’m doing?,8.9
S07E06,monica,You’re Lewis Posin.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,Who?,8.9
S07E06,monica,"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",8.9
S07E06,chandler,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,8.9
S07E06,monica,"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa….  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.,8.9
S07E06,monica,"No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!",8.9
S07E06,joey,"Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.",8.9
S07E06,ross,"No, 10 is the highest.",8.9
S07E06,joey,Why is 10 the highest?,8.9
S07E06,ross,Because it’s the highest.,8.9
S07E06,joey,I don’t want to marry Chandler!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Okay, uh…",8.9
S07E06,joey,I’ve got cold feet.,8.9
S07E06,rachel,…it’s gonna be okay!,8.9
S07E06,joey,"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.",8.9
S07E06,joey,"Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!",8.9
S07E06,rachel,Thanks!,8.9
S07E06,ross,"Yes, very nice Rachel.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,Thank you judges.,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Ugh, what a kiss ass.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,Oh!,8.9
S07E06,joey,"Okay, Phoebe…",8.9

S07E06,ross,—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Oh!,8.9

S07E06,rachel,Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!,8.9
S07E06,ross,It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…",8.9
S07E06,ross,Go!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as…  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",8.9
S07E06,joey,Wow.  Good speech.,8.9
S07E06,ross,"Yeah, it really was!",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Aw, thanks!",8.9
S07E06,ross,"Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next  although I really don’t see the point.",8.9
S07E06,joey,Yeah.,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.",8.9
S07E06,joey,And she’s back in the game.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,"It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.",8.9
S07E06,monica,It’s pretty clear.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",8.9
S07E06,joey,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Really?! I won!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,What?!,8.9
S07E06,ross,"I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,Well then I demand a recount!,8.9
S07E06,ross,"Actually, it wasn’t that close.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin!",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,The coins have finally forgiven me!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,You guys are the best!,8.9
S07E06,joey,"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.",8.9
S07E06,ross,Yeah?,8.9
S07E06,joey,Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.,8.9
S07E06,ross,Why-why would I care about that?,8.9
S07E06,joey,"No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.,8.9
S07E06,monica,Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,I would really love it if could do both.,8.9
S07E06,monica,"All right, I…I have to ask.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,What?,8.9
S07E06,monica,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,8.9
S07E06,chandler,What?!,8.9
S07E06,monica,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",8.9
S07E06,chandler,A hundred and forty-five pounds.,8.9
S07E06,monica,In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",8.9
S07E06,monica,"Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",8.9
S07E06,chandler,"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",8.9
S07E06,monica,How?,8.9
S07E06,chandler,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,8.9
S07E06,monica,"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!",8.9
S07E06,chandler,"Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",8.9
S07E06,monica,Keep going.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,8.9
S07E06,monica,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,8.9
S07E06,chandler,I’d carry you around in my pocket.,8.9
S07E06,monica,I love you.,8.9
S07E06,chandler,Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.,8.9
S07E06,rachel,Hi Pheebs.,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Hi!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Oh yeah!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Oh that’s so sweet thanks.,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Ohh.,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings.  I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,This stuff is great!,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue.  Yeah…",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.",8.9
S07E06,rachel,You do? Why?,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Because I think it means more to you.,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14?",8.9
S07E06,rachel,"No, I was ten. I just developed early.",8.9
S07E06,phoebe,Man alive!,8.9
S07E06,monica,"Hey, what’s going on?",8.9
S07E06,rachel,Hey!,8.9
S07E06,phoebe,"Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.",8.9
S07E06,monica,NA,8.9
S07E06,rachel,"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours.",8.9
S07E06,joey,Great nap.,8.9

S07E07,rachel,What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!,8.5
S07E07,joey,"Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!,8.5
S07E07,joey,"Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?",8.5
S07E07,joey,"Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.",8.5
S07E07,joey,Fine!,8.5
S07E07,rachel,Hi.,8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.",8.5

S07E07,ross,"Okay, okay take a guess.",8.5
S07E07,chandler,The hot chicks?,8.5

S07E07,chandler,Wow that’s actually pretty cool.,8.5
S07E07,ross,What is that?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,"You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?",8.5
S07E07,monica,She sent the chicken back again?!,8.5
S07E07,monica,Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!,8.5

S07E07,monica,"Well, she saw the ring.",8.5
S07E07,chandler,Did she freak out?,8.5
S07E07,monica,"Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.",8.5
S07E07,chandler,Right.,8.5
S07E07,monica,"Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.",8.5
S07E07,chandler,You said no right?,8.5
S07E07,monica,Huh?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,You said no right?!,8.5
S07E07,monica,"Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!",8.5
S07E07,chandler,Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!,8.5
S07E07,monica,Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!,8.5
S07E07,monica,"Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!",8.5
S07E07,chandler,Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.,8.5
S07E07,monica,Really?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?,8.5
S07E07,monica,So-so you would’ve just lied?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Yes!!,8.5
S07E07,monica,Would it really have been that easy?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Yes!!!,8.5

S07E07,joey,"Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,Whatever.,8.5

S07E07,ross,"Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!",8.5

S07E07,ross,No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!,8.5

S07E07,ross,"Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself!  And don’t you follow me!",8.5

S07E07,phoebe,Didn’t you sleep together?,8.5
S07E07,joey,"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a…",8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Oh, please don’t get married before I do.",8.5
S07E07,joey,Okay.,8.5
S07E07,monica,He might still show up.,8.5
S07E07,monica,Is that all?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.",8.5
S07E07,monica,It’s actually going to be just family.,8.5
S07E07,joey,How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!,8.5
S07E07,joey,What about Game 1 of the Series?,8.5
S07E07,joey,You shut up!  I’ll be right back.,8.5
S07E07,rachel,So how’s it goin’ with Joey?,8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!,8.5
S07E07,phoebe,Then change it back!,8.5
S07E07,phoebe,No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?,8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Ugh, tramp!",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,Does Joey have any idea?,8.5
S07E07,phoebe,"Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,"Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,"Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.",8.5
S07E07,joey,Hey! You wanna go?,8.5
S07E07,joey,Okay. See you guys later.,8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Yeah, see ya.",8.5
S07E07,joey,NA,8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,"No, just a regular old flying dwarf.",8.5
S07E07,ross,Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?,8.5
S07E07,ross,"Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?",8.5
S07E07,ross,"Ah… Ah…Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?",8.5
S07E07,ross,I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.,8.5
S07E07,ross,"I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.",8.5
S07E07,ross,Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!,8.5
S07E07,ross,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.",8.5
S07E07,ross,I am very…very sorry.,8.5
S07E07,joey,Hey!,8.5
S07E07,phoebe,Hey!,8.5
S07E07,rachel,Hi!,8.5
S07E07,phoebe,"So how was, how was your date?",8.5
S07E07,joey,"Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,8.5
S07E07,joey,"No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.",8.5
S07E07,joey,Where are you gettin’ this?,8.5
S07E07,rachel,"Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.",8.5
S07E07,joey,Oh. Oh.,8.5
S07E07,rachel,Joey…,8.5
S07E07,joey,"No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too!  Right?",8.5
S07E07,phoebe,"Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.,8.5
S07E07,joey,"No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.",8.5
S07E07,rachel,Well that too.  Joey?,8.5
S07E07,joey,Yeah?,8.5
S07E07,rachel,Do you want some pancakes?,8.5
S07E07,joey,Finally!,8.5
S07E07,monica,What are we gonna do?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,I say we go with Careless Whisper.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,8.5
S07E07,monica,"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",8.5
S07E07,monica,Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?,8.5
S07E07,monica,"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.",8.5
S07E07,monica,We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!",8.5
S07E07,monica,Kinda like your Barca lounger.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Is that what you’re thinking about right now?,8.5
S07E07,monica,I never stop thinking about it.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,"Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.",8.5
S07E07,chandler,"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",8.5
S07E07,monica,Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!,8.5
S07E07,monica,Because Chandler still has feelings for you!,8.5
S07E07,chandler,Say again?,8.5
S07E07,monica,That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.,8.5
S07E07,chandler,"Feelings, such strong feelings.",8.5
S07E07,monica,"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",8.5
S07E07,ross,"—Okay, see you later.",8.5
S07E07,chandler,I just wanted to show Monica your book.,8.5
S07E08,ross,Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"No, no, no. No-no-no.",8.2
S07E08,ross,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",8.2
S07E08,ross,What? That's like insanely easy!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .",8.2
S07E08,monica,"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",8.2
S07E08,ross,What? You forgot fourteen states?,8.2
S07E08,monica,Nobody cares about the Dakotas.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Oh, okay, time's up!",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"All right, I got 48.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?",8.2
S07E08,joey,Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.,8.2
S07E08,ross,"Wow, how many have you got?",8.2
S07E08,joey,Fifty-six!,8.2
S07E08,joey,Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,How come we have one extra place setting?,8.2
S07E08,monica,'Cause you invited your assistant.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",8.2
S07E08,monica,Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Regular Celery!,8.2
S07E08,ross,Done! With time a-to-spare.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,Oooh that may be a New World's record,8.2
S07E08,ross,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called \a globe?\"" Hmm?""",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.",8.2
S07E08,ross,What? That's impossible.,8.2
S07E08,joey,"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",8.2
S07E08,monica,"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!",8.2
S07E08,ross,"No, just give me another minute.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",8.2
S07E08,ross,"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!",8.2
S07E08,ross,You're on!,8.2
S07E08,joey,"All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?",8.2
S07E08,joey,"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?",8.2
S07E08,ross,Pshhshhh!,8.2
S07E08,monica,Chandler? Can you give me a hand?,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",8.2
S07E08,joey,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.,8.2
S07E08,ross,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Oh, it's not!",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Seriously, it's moving!",8.2
S07E08,joey,What the hell is in there?,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.,8.2
S07E08,monica,Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,8.2
S07E08,chandler,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,8.2
S07E08,monica,That's my pie!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,Which smells delicious!,8.2
S07E08,monica,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,What?,8.2
S07E08,monica,"We left Joey alone with the food!  Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?,8.2
S07E08,monica,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"I'm sorry, who's this?",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"No, there's no dog here?",8.2
S07E08,monica,Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Oh my god! Where are you?,8.2
S07E08,monica,I'll be right there!,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,They're here already? How are they doing this?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,Hi Tag! What are you doing here?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Well, sure! Come in!  Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry.",8.2
S07E08,ross,Ohio!! Thank you!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,Huh! Where is the dog?!,8.2
S07E08,ross,What dog? There-there's no dog here.,8.2
S07E08,joey,Yeah that dog left!,8.2
S07E08,monica,"Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,There's no dog in here.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"No that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,What is it doing here?,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",8.2
S07E08,chandler,Really?,8.2
S07E08,monica,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Well, it still has to go, right?",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, it's um…",8.2
S07E08,joey,Don't do it!,8.2
S07E08,monica,Don't do what?,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, I hate dogs.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Are you crazy?,8.2
S07E08,ross,Are you out of your mind?,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Why?,8.2
S07E08,joey,Told ya.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",8.2
S07E08,ross,"Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",8.2
S07E08,chandler,Is there a puppy here?,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, you are new!",8.2
S07E08,joey,"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,You don't like ice cream?,8.2
S07E08,ross,It's too cold.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",8.2
S07E08,ross,It hurts my teeth.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!",8.2
S07E08,ross,How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.,8.2
S07E08,monica,1250,8.2
S07E08,ross,"Damn, I forgot you were here.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",8.2
S07E08,monica,Yeah.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Oh, I'd say about a month.",8.2
S07E08,monica,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,8.2
S07E08,joey,Half hour.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,Interesting.,8.2
S07E08,monica,"When it's your assistant, I would say never.",8.2
S07E08,joey,"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,Huh. A moo-point?,8.2
S07E08,joey,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",8.2
S07E08,joey,"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,Hey!,8.2
S07E08,rachel,How are you holding up?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,So were you guys together a long time?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,Now that she broke up with you?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,Yeah. Hmmmm.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Because, uh—it has to.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!",8.2
S07E08,joey,"All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!",8.2
S07E08,joey,NA,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,What?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",8.2
S07E08,rachel,NA,8.2
S07E08,monica,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.",8.2
S07E08,monica,Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Yeah, okay.",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",8.2
S07E08,monica,That's not gonna work.,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.,8.2
S07E08,monica,Hey! I didn't know either.,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?",8.2
S07E08,monica,"Yeah, I knew.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Where's Chandler?,8.2
S07E08,chandler,Here I am.,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,Wash your hands!!!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,How did you…know?,8.2
S07E08,ross,Hey! What's she doing back here?,8.2
S07E08,monica,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",8.2
S07E08,ross,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",8.2
S07E08,ross,"Yeah, but, but look what I'm...",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,Where's Monica?,8.2
S07E08,ross,"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,Why not?,8.2
S07E08,ross,Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Well, I, I should go in there.",8.2
S07E08,ross,"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,Why not?,8.2
S07E08,ross,Because you sent away the dog!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,This is ridiculous.,8.2
S07E08,ross,"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",8.2
S07E08,joey,What's the matter?,8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",8.2
S07E08,joey,"So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",8.2
S07E08,joey,"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,And that doesn't scare you?,8.2
S07E08,joey,"Ross, you need some help?",8.2
S07E08,ross,"From you?  Yes, please!",8.2
S07E08,joey,"First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",8.2
S07E08,ross,"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.",8.2
S07E08,joey,Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",8.2
S07E08,joey,"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Hey, is Chandler here?",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"No, no he went for a walk.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!",8.2
S07E08,rachel,Hi!,8.2
S07E08,joey,Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",8.2
S07E08,joey,You think?,8.2
S07E08,monica,"Hi, honey.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",8.2
S07E08,monica,"What? Why, why would...",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and…",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"We have good news, look whose back!",8.2
S07E08,rachel,Hi!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,Clunkers?! Oh my god!,8.2
S07E08,monica,"That's right, she came back all by herself.",8.2
S07E08,phoebe,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,8.2
S07E08,chandler,It is so good to see you!,8.2
S07E08,phoebe,"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in… I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",8.2
S07E08,ross,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",8.2
S07E08,chandler,It's up to you.,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Oh, hi! How are you doing?",8.2
S07E08,rachel,Oh.,8.2

S07E08,ross,"Ah, what good are you.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.",8.2
S07E08,rachel,Really?,8.2
S07E08,rachel,"Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.",8.2
S07E08,ross,Delaware!  Delaware!,8.2

S07E09,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S07E09,phoebe,I never had a bike of my own.,8.1
S07E09,ross,What?!,8.1
S07E09,phoebe,"Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",8.1
S07E09,chandler,That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.,8.1
S07E09,ross,Ohh.,8.1
S07E09,monica,Did the girl ever let you ride it?,8.1
S07E09,phoebe,No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,8.1
S07E09,ross,That is so unfair!,8.1
S07E09,phoebe,"Not really, I got to drag him around too!",8.1
S07E09,chandler,Hey! What are you guys doing?,8.1

S07E09,monica,I’m gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.,8.1
S07E09,chandler,But we don’t know the neighbors.,8.1
S07E09,joey,"I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.",8.1
S07E09,monica,See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.,8.1
S07E09,chandler,Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?,8.1
S07E09,rachel,Gooood morning!!,8.1
S07E09,chandler,"Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!",8.1
S07E09,rachel,"Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!",8.1

S07E09,rachel,"Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.",8.1
S07E09,rachel,"Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.",8.1
S07E09,rachel,"No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",8.1
S07E09,monica,"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!",8.1

S07E09,phoebe,Sure!,8.1
S07E09,ross,"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so…",8.1

S07E09,phoebe,Okay.  See?,8.1
S07E09,monica,"See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!",8.1
S07E09,chandler,What happened? I’m just eating candy.,8.1
S07E09,rachel,"Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.",8.1

S07E09,joey,"Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?",8.1

S07E09,monica,"All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!",8.1
S07E09,monica,It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!,8.1

S07E09,rachel,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",8.1

S07E10,chandler,Had the money in the wrong hand.,8.5
S07E10,ross,"Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Okay, it's not a contest.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!",8.5
S07E10,ross,Yes! Santa's coming!,8.5
S07E10,monica,"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!",8.5
S07E10,chandler,How do you know so much about this?,8.5
S07E10,monica,I don't know.,8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?",8.5
S07E10,monica,We'd be eating our soup right now.,8.5
S07E10,chandler,Mustached bastard…,8.5
S07E10,monica,"Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!",8.5
S07E10,chandler,Excuse me...,8.5
S07E10,chandler,NA,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Ha!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!",8.5
S07E10,joey,"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,That's fun.,8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Thank you.",8.5
S07E10,joey,Thank you.  Hey Pheebs!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Hey!,8.5
S07E10,joey,Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.,8.5
S07E10,chandler,Hey Pheebs!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Hey!,8.5
S07E10,chandler,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",8.5
S07E10,monica,"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, \Oh my eye! Oh god",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",8.5
S07E10,monica,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Maybe on some level.,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",8.5
S07E10,joey,What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,NA,8.5
S07E10,joey,"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"It's a…tarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",8.5
S07E10,rachel,"What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",8.5
S07E10,joey,"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!",8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,NA,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Our apartment is ready.,8.5
S07E10,rachel,And that makes you angry because…,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Because you would rather live here with Joey.,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Where did you get that?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Phoebe?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Hm?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Fish!,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…",8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"We did have fun, didn't we?",8.5
S07E10,rachel,We did!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Oh, I would love to!",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Yay, okay!",8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Good, good, good, good, good.",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",8.5
S07E10,rachel,Done!,8.5
S07E10,ross,Hey!,8.5
S07E10,ross,"No, these are my pants.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.",8.5
S07E10,ross,I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!,8.5
S07E10,monica,"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",8.5
S07E10,ross,Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.,8.5
S07E10,monica,"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!",8.5
S07E10,ross,"You are? Me, too!",8.5
S07E10,monica,Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?,8.5
S07E10,ross,"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?",8.5
S07E10,ross,Yeah!,8.5
S07E10,monica,Come on Ben.,8.5
S07E10,ross,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",8.5
S07E10,chandler,Hey!,8.5
S07E10,ross,"What are you doing here, Santa?",8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",8.5
S07E10,chandler,What?,8.5
S07E10,chandler,"You bet I did, Ben, put it there!  Ho, ho, ho!",8.5
S07E10,monica,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",8.5
S07E10,ross,What are you doing?,8.5
S07E10,chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.",8.5
S07E10,chandler,Why?,8.5
S07E10,ross,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.",8.5
S07E10,chandler,But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,8.5
S07E10,ross,"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.",8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back.",8.5
S07E10,monica,NA,8.5
S07E10,chandler,Santa? Really?,8.5
S07E10,monica,"Yes, is that okay?",8.5
S07E10,chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,8.5
S07E10,monica,No.,8.5
S07E10,chandler,Then it's okay!,8.5
S07E10,ross,"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!",8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",8.5
S07E10,ross,"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.",8.5
S07E10,chandler,"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",8.5
S07E10,ross,"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.",8.5
S07E10,joey,Merry Christmas!,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Oh wow! Look at this place!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!",8.5
S07E10,rachel,Oh my God!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,What?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Yeah?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Yeah?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Do you really not know where I’m going with this?  It left! It’s one huge room!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Oh no!  Oh! Wow!!!,8.5
S07E10,rachel,See?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.",8.5
S07E10,rachel,"You can’t, because of the new skylight!",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,There’s a skylight?!  Wow!!,8.5
S07E10,rachel,So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.",8.5
S07E10,rachel,Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"A little bit, yeah.",8.5
S07E10,rachel,Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,You heard her too?! You have the gift!,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Are you sure?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Oh me too.,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"I know.  Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?",8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"No, I do not hear that.",8.5
S07E10,ross,"…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…",8.5
S07E10,ross,"That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.",8.5
S07E10,ross,Yeah?,8.5
S07E10,chandler,My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.,8.5
S07E10,ross,"The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!",8.5
S07E10,rachel,Hey!,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Oh.,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.,8.5
S07E10,ross,"Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!",8.5
S07E10,rachel,Oh.,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,Oh.,8.5
S07E10,phoebe,"Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?",8.5
S07E10,rachel,I got it!,8.5
S07E10,joey,Is it back in the cage?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,Its back in cage!,8.5
S07E10,joey,Cage closed?,8.5
S07E10,rachel,"Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!",8.5
S07E11,chandler,Ohh. Mmm.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,Hi.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.",8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—",8.6
S07E11,chandler,It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.",8.6
S07E11,chandler,I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Why, why not?",8.6
S07E11,chandler,Because it's too delicious.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",8.6
S07E11,chandler,"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry what?",8.6
S07E11,joey,"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.",8.6
S07E11,chandler,So…,8.6
S07E11,joey,"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Absolutely!,8.6
S07E11,joey,I’ll see you at 8:00.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Okay.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,"Oh, what’s at 8:00?",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Duly noted.,8.6
S07E11,ross,"Thanks.  Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?",8.6
S07E11,monica,What are you talking about?,8.6
S07E11,ross,"Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.",8.6
S07E11,monica,You were invited?!,8.6
S07E11,ross,No.,8.6
S07E11,monica,"My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!",8.6
S07E11,chandler,"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",8.6
S07E11,monica,"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Y’know, she tried to undress me too.",8.6
S07E11,chandler,I used to undress my cousin Glenn.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.",8.6
S07E11,rachel,Big Daddy?,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.,8.6
S07E11,ross,"Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!",8.6
S07E11,joey,Hey!,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!,8.6
S07E11,joey,Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!,8.6
S07E11,joey,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",8.6
S07E11,joey,Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Well, it does.",8.6
S07E11,joey,"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Okay, you wore me down.",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?",8.6
S07E11,joey,The Ross—Is that back?!!,8.6
S07E11,rachel,Hi!,8.6
S07E11,chandler,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?",8.6
S07E11,chandler,I can’t seem to say goodbye.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",8.6
S07E11,chandler,Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling…  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!",8.6
S07E11,chandler,Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,8.6
S07E11,rachel,"Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.",8.6
S07E11,joey,Awww! Mel Torme died.,8.6
S07E11,monica,"Joey, that paper’s like a year old!",8.6
S07E11,joey,Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!,8.6
S07E11,ross,Hey.,8.6
S07E11,joey,Hey.,8.6
S07E11,monica,Hey.,8.6
S07E11,ross,"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.",8.6
S07E11,monica,Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!,8.6
S07E11,ross,"Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",8.6
S07E11,monica,"Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.",8.6
S07E11,monica,Joan?,8.6
S07E11,ross,"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!",8.6
S07E11,monica,"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got \and guest?!\""",8.6
S07E11,joey,"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…",8.6
S07E11,ross,Not broad backed!,8.6
S07E11,monica,"Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!",8.6
S07E11,ross,What? I can’t cancel on Joan!,8.6
S07E11,monica,Why not?!,8.6
S07E11,ross,"Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?",8.6
S07E11,monica,"Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.",8.6
S07E11,ross,"Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan.",8.6
S07E11,joey,"Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.",8.6
S07E11,monica,We’ll see.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,"Well, thank you for lunch.",8.6
S07E11,rachel,"What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!",8.6
S07E11,chandler,So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?,8.6
S07E11,rachel,NA,8.6
S07E11,chandler,Mrs. Braverman must be out.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",8.6
S07E11,rachel,No that could kill her.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,"Well, we don’t want that.",8.6
S07E11,rachel,No so we’re protecting her.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,But we should take it.,8.6
S07E11,rachel,But we should move quick.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,Why?,8.6
S07E11,rachel,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,8.6
S07E11,chandler,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Oh my God! That’s David!,8.6
S07E11,monica,David who?,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Yeah.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Really?,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Yeah.,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Yes! Oh no!,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?",8.6
S07E11,monica,"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",8.6
S07E11,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.6
S07E11,monica,What are you doing?,8.6
S07E11,phoebe,"Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.",8.6
S07E11,monica,So! He’ll understand!,8.6

S07E13,joey,As in Rosita does not move.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?",8.4
S07E13,joey,The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Stevie the TV?,8.4
S07E13,joey,Is there a problem?,8.4
S07E13,rachel,No!  You bitch!,8.4

S07E13,phoebe,What? What happened to the window in the attic?!,8.4
S07E13,monica,I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!,8.4
S07E13,ross,I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!,8.4
S07E13,ross,Who did you leave a message with?,8.4
S07E13,chandler,NA,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry.",8.4
S07E13,joey,"I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.",8.4
S07E13,joey,She’s not even cold yet!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.",8.4
S07E13,joey,That’s true.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Okay? You ready?,8.4
S07E13,joey,"Yeah, I…  I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.",8.4
S07E13,ross,"I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.",8.4
S07E13,monica,"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.",8.4
S07E13,ross,They kept your room for a while.,8.4
S07E13,monica,"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Come on, you know they love you.",8.4
S07E13,monica,As much as they love you?,8.4
S07E13,ross,I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.,8.4

S07E13,phoebe,"Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!",8.4
S07E13,monica,That was me and Ross.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,Oh that’s right!,8.4
S07E13,ross,"Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.",8.4
S07E13,monica,Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much.",8.4
S07E13,ross,What?,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Oh yeah, like you never called!",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.",8.4

S07E13,phoebe,"Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,Oh.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?",8.4
S07E13,chandler,Joey! Joe!,8.4

S07E13,monica,"Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…",8.4
S07E13,monica,I used to love to play restaurant.,8.4
S07E13,ross,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",8.4
S07E13,monica,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Oooh, my rock polisher!",8.4

S07E13,ross,What?,8.4
S07E13,ross,How are you ever going to sell this place?,8.4
S07E13,ross,"Oh no. Dad! Dad! What… Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!",8.4
S07E13,ross,No!,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,NA,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,May I ask why?,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,I surely do!,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,Chandler?,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",8.4
S07E13,chandler,"My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,You will like it!,8.4
S07E13,joey,No I won’t.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,You don’t even know!,8.4
S07E13,joey,"Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Well look, if you don’t like this…",8.4
S07E13,joey,I don’t know why you say that so soon.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.",8.4
S07E13,joey,Francette? What is she? A couch?,8.4
S07E13,joey,Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?",8.4
S07E13,joey,"Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  She’s heeled!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,That’s weird.,8.4
S07E13,joey,"No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.,8.4
S07E13,joey,"Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Joey, I really don’t…",8.4
S07E13,joey,Can you tell me how this happened?,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Well no.,8.4
S07E13,joey,Miracle!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",8.4
S07E13,joey,Someone like an…angel?,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.",8.4
S07E13,joey,NA,8.4
S07E13,ross,"Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Well, can you blame her?",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.",8.4

S07E13,rachel,I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!,8.4
S07E13,joey,"Yeah, me too.",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?",8.4

S07E13,rachel,Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!,8.4
S07E13,joey,My chair heels itself.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Oh sorry, boyfriend!",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"No, whatever! Anything!",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Yeah, he’s gotta go.",8.4

S07E13,ross,"Umm, your boxes are umm…",8.4
S07E13,monica,What?,8.4
S07E13,ross,Dad?,8.4
S07E13,monica,Just mine?,8.4
S07E13,monica,So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined?  And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!,8.4
S07E13,monica,"So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!",8.4
S07E13,monica,I can’t believe this!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Hey Chandler!,8.4
S07E13,chandler,Hey!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",8.4
S07E13,chandler,"Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",8.4
S07E13,chandler,Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?,8.4
S07E13,rachel,I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.,8.4
S07E13,chandler,That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…",8.4
S07E13,chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Yeah.,8.4
S07E13,chandler,I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!,8.4
S07E13,chandler,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?",8.4
S07E13,rachel,Noo!  Angels.,8.4
S07E13,chandler,I’m gettin’ my chair back!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,What? Wh-hey!,8.4
S07E13,joey,"Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!",8.4
S07E13,chandler,Joey you broke my chair!!,8.4
S07E13,joey,Your chair?!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!",8.4
S07E13,joey,"So, there was no miracle?!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"No Joe, no miracle.",8.4
S07E13,joey,Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,"Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!",8.4
S07E13,chandler,I think I should get the chair!,8.4
S07E13,joey,How do you figure?,8.4
S07E13,chandler,"Because you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.,8.4
S07E13,chandler,"Well, where’s the logic in that?!",8.4
S07E13,rachel,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",8.4
S07E13,chandler,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!,8.4
S07E13,joey,That’s right!,8.4
S07E13,chandler,What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!,8.4
S07E13,joey,Yeah! We are!,8.4
S07E13,rachel,We’re the Cobras!,8.4

S07E13,phoebe,No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,Because it was fate that made me call you today!,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,Yes.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.,8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"No, it’s fate!",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Sure!  Umm, where are you from?",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",8.4
S07E13,phoebe,"Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place.  Oh no, it’s you.",8.4
S07E13,monica,"Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  What do you think this is?",8.4
S07E13,ross,All right. I think it was a mouse.,8.4
S07E13,monica,How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!,8.4
S07E13,monica,What’s this?,8.4
S07E13,monica,What?!,8.4
S07E13,ross,What?!!!,8.4
S07E13,monica,"Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!",8.4
S07E13,ross,"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!",8.4
S07E13,monica,All right!,8.4
S07E13,ross,"Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!",8.4
S07E13,joey,Oh yeah.,8.4
S07E13,rachel,Ahhhh….,8.4

S07E13,rachel,"Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.",8.4
S07E13,monica,Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever!,8.4
S07E14,ross,Happy birthday!!!,8.6
S07E14,monica,Happy birthday!!!,8.6
S07E14,monica,It’s your birthday!,8.6

S07E14,monica,They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.,8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?",8.6
S07E14,joey,"Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.",8.6
S07E14,ross,Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?,8.6

S07E14,rachel,Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?,8.6
S07E14,chandler,"No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.",8.6
S07E14,joey,NA,8.6
S07E14,monica,"Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…",8.6
S07E14,joey,"Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star.",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.",8.6
S07E14,rachel,There you go!,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.,8.6
S07E14,monica,"Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.",8.6
S07E14,ross,Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!,8.6
S07E14,ross,"How hot do I look in this, huh?!",8.6
S07E14,chandler,"Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",8.6
S07E14,ross,That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.,8.6
S07E14,joey,"Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?",8.6
S07E14,ross,"I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!",8.6
S07E14,monica,I can’t believe you bought this.,8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?",8.6
S07E14,ross,Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.,8.6

S07E14,phoebe,Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.,8.6
S07E14,rachel,So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch!!,8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Get out, get out of my apartment.",8.6
S07E14,monica,"All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,Least of all you.,8.6
S07E14,monica,Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?,8.6

S07E14,phoebe,Yay! I love drunk Monica!,8.6
S07E14,monica,Awwwww…,8.6
S07E14,chandler,She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.,8.6

S07E14,rachel,What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!,8.6
S07E14,chandler,Monica’s wasted.,8.6
S07E14,ross,Maybe that will liven up this party.,8.6
S07E14,chandler,"Okay, will you just go help her change please!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",8.6
S07E14,joey,Yep.,8.6
S07E14,rachel,Ahh!,8.6
S07E14,rachel,NA,8.6
S07E14,ross,Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.,8.6

S07E14,joey,"Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?",8.6
S07E14,chandler,"For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Okay.  That’s funny, yeah!",8.6
S07E14,chandler,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,8.6
S07E14,rachel,"No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!",8.6
S07E14,chandler,"No, because you’re not a grandmother!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny.",8.6
S07E14,monica,All you had to do was buy the card!,8.6
S07E14,ross,Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?,8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.",8.6
S07E14,ross,What?,8.6
S07E14,rachel,Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",8.6
S07E14,rachel,As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",8.6
S07E14,monica,"Really! That long?!  Look all you want, it’s happening!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.",8.6
S07E14,ross,Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!,8.6
S07E14,rachel,"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",8.6
S07E14,joey,Will you quit hoggin’ it!,8.6
S07E14,rachel,I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.,8.6
S07E14,ross,You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.,8.6
S07E14,chandler,There we go.,8.6
S07E14,joey,Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?,8.6
S07E14,chandler,How are you feeling?,8.6
S07E14,monica,"You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!",8.6
S07E14,ross,I really wish that you wouldn’t.,8.6
S07E14,chandler,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?,8.6
S07E14,chandler,Pheebs!!,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!,8.6
S07E14,ross,Come on!,8.6
S07E14,chandler,I think it’s necessary.,8.6

S07E14,joey,"Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",8.6
S07E14,joey,That’s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",8.6
S07E14,joey,Like what?,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!",8.6
S07E14,monica,"Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,"No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.",8.6
S07E14,joey,"Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home.",8.6
S07E14,monica,Oh man!,8.6

S07E14,monica,He’s gonna eat the cake!,8.6
S07E14,joey,Pheebs! Wait up!  Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.,8.6
S07E14,phoebe,Oh yeah.,8.6
S07E14,joey,"Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.",8.6
S07E14,phoebe,Oh!,8.6
S07E14,ross,"Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!",8.6
S07E14,rachel,"Ross, I really don’t think…",8.6
S07E14,ross,Lift!! And slide!,8.6
S07E14,chandler,"Okay, here we go.",8.6

S07E15,joey,"Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.",8.4
S07E15,ross,It’s ridiculous!,8.4
S07E15,joey,"Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months.",8.4
S07E15,ross,NA,8.4
S07E15,monica,Who are they killing off?,8.4
S07E15,joey,"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.",8.4

S07E15,rachel,"Well, I'd have to say gay.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Yeah? Why?,8.4
S07E15,rachel,Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.,8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.,8.4
S07E15,phoebe,NA,8.4

S07E15,phoebe,"Ohh, he left his cell phone.",8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?,8.4
S07E15,phoebe,I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,"That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together… having sex.",8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Yeah!  And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Nice try.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?,8.4
S07E15,phoebe,I don’t know.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Well umm, maybe we could uhh…  Ah-ha! Too slow!!",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Ah-ha! Too cocky!,8.4

S07E15,joey,"Oh uh, one of the writers.",8.4
S07E15,joey,Umm…,8.4
S07E15,joey,Okay.,8.4
S07E15,joey,Ms. Monroe…,8.4
S07E15,rachel,"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",8.4
S07E15,rachel,I don’t think so.,8.4
S07E15,phoebe,"Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",8.4
S07E15,rachel,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,8.4
S07E15,rachel,Yes okay.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!,8.4
S07E15,phoebe,"Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.",8.4
S07E15,rachel,"Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.",8.4
S07E15,phoebe,"So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?",8.4
S07E15,rachel,His new girlfriend!,8.4
S07E15,monica,What is that?,8.4
S07E15,chandler,I think it’s the dying cat parade.,8.4
S07E15,monica,It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.,8.4
S07E15,chandler,Oh my God!,8.4
S07E15,monica,What?,8.4

S07E15,monica,"He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!",8.4
S07E15,chandler,"If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.",8.4

S07E16,monica,Okay!,8.7
S07E16,monica,Y’know what’s weird?,8.7

S07E16,joey,"All right, here you go buddy.",8.7
S07E16,joey,"That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.",8.7
S07E16,monica,"Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.",8.7
S07E16,joey,Oh…  Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!,8.7
S07E16,phoebe,"Yeah, it’s totally meant to be.  Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.",8.7
S07E16,monica,What?!,8.7
S07E16,chandler,What?,8.7
S07E16,phoebe,What?!,8.7
S07E16,chandler,Who did you originally want to hook up with?,8.7
S07E16,monica,"Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey.",8.7
S07E16,joey,Yeah baby!  No baby!,8.7
S07E16,chandler,So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?,8.7
S07E16,monica,No because it-it didn’t seem important.,8.7
S07E16,chandler,"Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him  not me!",8.7
S07E16,monica,Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!,8.7
S07E16,joey,And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—,8.7
S07E16,chandler,I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.,8.7
S07E16,monica,"Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!",8.7
S07E16,joey,"Hey!  Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!",8.7
S07E16,chandler,Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?,8.7
S07E16,joey,"What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?!  I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!",8.7
S07E16,chandler,"Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.",8.7
S07E16,monica,"Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!",8.7
S07E16,chandler,"It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.",8.7

S07E16,ross,"Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!",8.7
S07E16,rachel,"That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, \I will be revenged?!\""",8.7
S07E16,ross,"I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",8.7
S07E16,rachel,"Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!",8.7
S07E16,ross,"No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…",8.7
S07E16,rachel,"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!",8.7
S07E16,rachel,I gotta go!,8.7
S07E16,joey,Hey.,8.7
S07E16,chandler,Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!,8.7
S07E16,joey,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!",8.7
S07E16,chandler,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…",8.7
S07E16,joey,"No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.",8.7
S07E16,chandler,How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!,8.7
S07E16,joey,"Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.",8.7
S07E16,chandler,That’s what you should say.,8.7
S07E16,joey,What?,8.7
S07E16,chandler,When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.,8.7
S07E16,joey,Really? I can do it?,8.7
S07E16,chandler,I’d love it if you would do it.,8.7

S07E17,chandler,What are you guys talking about?,8.4
S07E17,monica,"Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.",8.4
S07E17,rachel,"Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.",8.4
S07E17,chandler,But I love swing music!,8.4
S07E17,phoebe,Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.,8.4
S07E17,chandler,"Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.",8.4
S07E17,rachel,"Well, what is the other reason?",8.4
S07E17,chandler,I don’t want to say.,8.4
S07E17,rachel,Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.,8.4
S07E17,chandler,Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.,8.4
S07E17,monica,Oh crap!,8.4
S07E17,ross,So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.,8.4
S07E17,ross,Yeah.,8.4
S07E17,ross,Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.,8.4
S07E17,joey,Kristen?,8.4
S07E17,joey,Hi!,8.4
S07E17,joey,"Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…",8.4
S07E17,joey,Hi!,8.4
S07E17,ross,Hi.  It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.,8.4
S07E17,ross,Yeah. So…,8.4
S07E17,joey,Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!,8.4
S07E17,ross,"So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?",8.4
S07E17,ross,"That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?",8.4
S07E17,joey,A woman in a man’s body.,8.4
S07E17,ross,Much better.,8.4
S07E17,joey,"So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?",8.4
S07E17,ross,"Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.",8.4
S07E17,ross,"That’s right! Wait no, Ben.",8.4
S07E17,joey,So you’ve just married the one time then?,8.4
S07E17,ross,Well umm…,8.4
S07E17,ross,"Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?",8.4
S07E17,joey,"Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?",8.4
S07E17,joey,No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.,8.4
S07E17,ross,Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?,8.4
S07E17,joey,Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!,8.4

S07E18,phoebe,Go for it.,8.4
S07E18,monica,"Phoebe, I’m engaged!",8.4
S07E18,phoebe,"I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.",8.4
S07E18,monica,"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged.",8.4
S07E18,monica,Well you should be embarrassed.,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,"I did, but that was really fun.",8.4
S07E18,joey,"my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…",8.4

S07E18,joey,What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?,8.4

S07E18,joey,"Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.",8.4
S07E18,rachel,"Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like…",8.4
S07E18,joey,Hey!,8.4

S07E18,phoebe,"Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.",8.4
S07E18,monica,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.",8.4
S07E18,phoebe,"All I could think of was y’know, \Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?\""",8.4
S07E18,monica,And did he?,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,"I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.",8.4
S07E18,monica,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",8.4
S07E18,phoebe,I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.,8.4
S07E18,monica,"Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?",8.4
S07E18,phoebe,You sound like a guy.,8.4
S07E18,monica,"No, a guy would be saying, \I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.\"" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean",8.4
S07E18,phoebe,You’ll have a last kiss.,8.4
S07E18,ross,Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?,8.4
S07E18,joey,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?,8.4
S07E18,ross,There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.,8.4
S07E18,joey,Whoa!,8.4
S07E18,rachel,Whoa what?,8.4
S07E18,joey,Ross has a boyfriend.,8.4

S07E18,rachel,Really?,8.4
S07E18,ross,"Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?",8.4
S07E18,rachel,Not right now.,8.4
S07E18,ross,It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.,8.4
S07E18,rachel,"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.",8.4
S07E18,ross,Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.,8.4
S07E18,rachel,Yeah.,8.4
S07E18,joey,How’d you get over that teacher?,8.4
S07E18,rachel,I didn’t. I got under him.,8.4
S07E18,joey,Problem solved.,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,Okay bye.,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,Bye!  We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.,8.4
S07E18,monica,"Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…",8.4
S07E18,phoebe,NA,8.4
S07E18,monica,"See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy.  Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?",8.4

S07E18,rachel,No! Joey!,8.4
S07E18,joey,Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.,8.4
S07E18,rachel,Do you really want an award you didn’t win?,8.4
S07E18,joey,"No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there  right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.",8.4
S07E18,rachel,Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!,8.4
S07E18,joey,I can scratch that right off.,8.4
S07E18,rachel,"Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.",8.4

S07E18,ross,I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.,8.4
S07E18,monica,Have you seen Chandler?,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,No. Why?,8.4
S07E18,monica,‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.,8.4

S07E18,monica,You gotta help me out here Pheebs.,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,"All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.",8.4
S07E18,monica,So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?,8.4
S07E18,phoebe,"That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.",8.4
S07E18,monica,Your mother told you this?,8.4

S07E18,chandler,What?,8.4
S07E18,monica,"Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?",8.4

S07E18,monica,"Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?",8.4
S07E18,chandler,"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.",8.4
S07E18,monica,Even with me?,8.4
S07E18,chandler,"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.",8.4
S07E18,monica,Really?,8.4
S07E18,chandler,"Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.",8.4

S07E19,phoebe,Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?,8.7
S07E19,monica,Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.,8.7
S07E19,ross,A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Sure.,8.7
S07E19,monica,"I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.",8.7
S07E19,ross,Cassie?,8.7
S07E19,monica,Uh-hmm.,8.7
S07E19,ross,"Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.",8.7
S07E19,monica,"Ross, she’s 25 years old.",8.7
S07E19,ross,So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Hi!,8.7
S07E19,monica,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Yeah!,8.7
S07E19,monica,Subtle guys!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,What?!,8.7
S07E19,monica,I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!,8.7
S07E19,monica,Okay. Sorry.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!,8.7
S07E19,monica,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,8.7
S07E19,joey,"I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.",8.7
S07E19,monica,That’s what you say about porn.,8.7
S07E19,joey,You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.,8.7
S07E19,monica,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!,8.7
S07E19,joey,Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Well when can we have this shower?,8.7
S07E19,rachel,She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Yesterday!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!",8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Rachel, calm down!",8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Just calm down woman!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Phoebe, I already, I already did.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.",8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Uh, here. What time?",8.7
S07E19,rachel,4 o’clock. Food?,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Finger sandwiches and tea.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Ooh great! Very Monica.,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,And chili!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Both!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,We’re paying for this y’know.,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Neither.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Lusts of the flesh.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,What?,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,I don’t know.  A cowboy theme?,8.7
S07E19,chandler,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,monica,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,chandler,Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.,8.7
S07E19,monica,Oh boy me too!,8.7
S07E19,chandler,Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…,8.7
S07E19,monica,Yeah?,8.7
S07E19,chandler,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",8.7
S07E19,monica,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",8.7
S07E19,chandler,That’s me! Come on!,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.",8.7
S07E19,chandler,"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",8.7
S07E19,monica,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,8.7
S07E19,chandler,Hi! Nice to meet you!,8.7
S07E19,monica,"So, are you ready to go?",8.7
S07E19,monica,Chandler!,8.7
S07E19,chandler,I’ll be right with you.,8.7
S07E19,monica,Cassie needs to stay at your place.,8.7
S07E19,ross,What—why?,8.7
S07E19,monica,Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.,8.7
S07E19,ross,What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!,8.7
S07E19,chandler,I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.,8.7
S07E19,monica,You were staring about eight inches south of there.,8.7
S07E19,ross,"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",8.7
S07E19,monica,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,8.7
S07E19,chandler,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",8.7
S07E19,monica,Wafer thin ice!,8.7
S07E19,joey,"Hey, I’m back!",8.7
S07E19,joey,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",8.7
S07E19,joey,"Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!",8.7
S07E19,joey,And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?,8.7
S07E19,joey,Wow! Sure! That’s great!,8.7
S07E19,joey,"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",8.7
S07E19,joey,So…What?,8.7
S07E19,joey,Yes!,8.7
S07E19,joey,No. What?,8.7
S07E19,joey,Barmifsaed?,8.7
S07E19,monica,So to get this part you can’t be?,8.7
S07E19,joey,Nope.,8.7
S07E19,monica,But you are?,8.7
S07E19,joey,Yep.,8.7
S07E19,monica,But you told them you weren’t?,8.7
S07E19,joey,That’s right.,8.7
S07E19,monica,Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?,8.7
S07E19,joey,"I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",8.7
S07E19,monica,Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!,8.7
S07E19,joey,I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",8.7
S07E19,joey,I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part.,8.7
S07E19,monica,Unless!,8.7
S07E19,joey,Unless what?,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",8.7
S07E19,joey,Like what?,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Well I’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.",8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?",8.7
S07E19,monica,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Hey! What’s up Mon?,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?",8.7
S07E19,rachel,Have at it.,8.7
S07E19,monica,Okay.  I hope that won’t work.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Are you makin’ him a sandwich?,8.7
S07E19,monica,"No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.",8.7
S07E19,monica,I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,We have to get her a present?!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book!  We have a guest list!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.",8.7
S07E19,ross,Cassie?!,8.7
S07E19,ross,Hey!,8.7
S07E19,ross,"Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.",8.7
S07E19,ross,"It’s okay. Come, come on in.",8.7
S07E19,ross,Oh.,8.7
S07E19,ross,Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.,8.7
S07E19,ross,Yeah—No!!,8.7
S07E19,ross,"Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.",8.7
S07E19,ross,Thank God.,8.7
S07E19,ross,"Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?  We’re probably too old to do that now.",8.7
S07E19,ross,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.,8.7
S07E19,ross,"Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Hi!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"How are you?  Hi, thanks for coming.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Thank you.  Oh, it’s so nice to see you.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Okay.  Hey Rach?,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Yeah?,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,Who the hell are all these people?,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!",8.7
S07E19,rachel,Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Ohhhh!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,That’s great!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,You didn’t tell her to come?!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,You were supposed to tell her!,8.7
S07E19,rachel,No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Fine, I’ll go call her.",8.7
S07E19,rachel,Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.",8.7
S07E19,joey,Wow! This looks great!,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.",8.7
S07E19,joey,And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Oh, just until the glue dries.",8.7
S07E19,joey,Thank God!,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",8.7
S07E19,joey,Ah.,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Okay?  Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.",8.7
S07E19,joey,Well maybe we just take that one away.,8.7
S07E19,monica,"I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me.  Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.",8.7
S07E19,joey,"Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.",8.7
S07E19,joey,Ow!,8.7
S07E19,monica,Toothpick?,8.7
S07E19,joey,Yeah.,8.7
S07E19,monica,What are you trying on now?,8.7

S07E19,ross,"Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.",8.7
S07E19,monica,Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",8.7
S07E19,monica,For what?,8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",8.7

S07E19,monica,You al-you already had it?,8.7
S07E19,phoebe,"Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.",8.7
S07E19,rachel,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.",8.7
S07E19,phoebe,We ruined everything.,8.7
S07E19,rachel,Ugh…,8.7
S07E19,monica,"Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.",8.7

S07E20,chandler,"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, \You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!\""",8.4

S07E20,rachel,It’s a pretty cool tux.,8.4
S07E20,chandler,"Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?",8.4
S07E20,joey,We should really learn how to play the real way.,8.4
S07E20,phoebe,I like our way. Oh!  Chess!,8.4

S07E20,chandler,You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!,8.4
S07E20,ross,So?,8.4
S07E20,chandler,So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,8.4

S07E20,joey,"Yeah, they’re not coming.",8.4
S07E20,monica,What?!,8.4
S07E20,joey,Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.,8.4
S07E20,monica,"Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.",8.4
S07E20,joey,"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…",8.4
S07E20,monica,Oh Joey!,8.4

S07E20,joey,Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?,8.4
S07E20,monica,"Well, what am I going to say?",8.4
S07E20,joey,"I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so…",8.4

S07E20,monica,"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.",8.4

S07E20,joey,"Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!",8.4
S07E20,monica,The wedding starts at six.,8.4
S07E20,joey,"Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?",8.4
S07E20,monica,You’ll vamp?!,8.4
S07E20,joey,"Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer!  There is no one better! There is no one greater!",8.4

S07E20,ross,Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.,8.4
S07E20,chandler,"Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?",8.4

S07E21,monica,Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.,7.5
S07E21,phoebe,Oh! Yeah!,7.5

S07E21,monica,"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",7.5

S07E22,phoebe,"Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.",8.4
S07E22,monica,"Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.",8.4
S07E22,ross,Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.,8.4

S07E22,ross,Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.,8.4

S07E22,rachel,NA,8.4
S07E22,monica,"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.",8.4
S07E22,monica,Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.,8.4
S07E22,chandler,I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.,8.4
S07E22,monica,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,8.4
S07E22,chandler,"Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,"Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.",8.4
S07E22,monica,So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.,8.4
S07E22,phoebe,"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.",8.4

S07E22,chandler,Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!!  We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?,8.4
S07E22,monica,"We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,Y’know we already went over this and I won!,8.4
S07E22,monica,"No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.,8.4
S07E22,monica,"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…",8.4
S07E22,chandler,"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",8.4
S07E22,monica,"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!,8.4
S07E22,monica,Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?,8.4
S07E22,chandler,Does it matter?!,8.4
S07E22,monica,"Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,"Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.",8.4
S07E22,monica,Yes!,8.4
S07E22,chandler,So I really never get to win anymore?,8.4
S07E22,monica,How much did ever really win before?,8.4
S07E22,joey,Pheebs!,8.4
S07E22,phoebe,Hey!,8.4
S07E22,joey,"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,Yeah!,8.4
S07E22,joey,"Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,I know. They were mine.,8.4
S07E22,joey,"Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,"No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",8.4
S07E22,joey,That’s weird!,8.4
S07E22,phoebe,I’m wearing his briefs right now.,8.4
S07E22,joey,That’s…kinda hot.,8.4
S07E22,phoebe,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,8.4
S07E22,joey,"Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,8.4
S07E22,joey,"Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.,8.4
S07E22,joey,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.",8.4
S07E22,phoebe,I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.,8.4
S07E22,joey,Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.,8.4
S07E22,phoebe,Okay whatever.,8.4
S07E22,joey,You’ve seen my huge stack of porn right?,8.4
S07E22,rachel,God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.,8.4
S07E22,ross,You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!,8.4
S07E22,rachel,Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax…,8.4
S07E22,ross,What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!,8.4
S07E22,rachel,I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.,8.4
S07E22,rachel,Uh-oh.,8.4
S07E22,ross,"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.",8.4
S07E22,rachel,Really? You think so?,8.4
S07E22,ross,I was talking to myself! You’re going down!,8.4
S07E22,monica,"Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did.  I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…",8.4
S07E22,chandler,"Yeah, I just ordered a beer!",8.4
S07E22,monica,I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.,8.4
S07E22,chandler,No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.,8.4
S07E22,monica,Why not?!,8.4
S07E22,chandler,"I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years",8.4
S07E22,monica,What?!,8.4
S07E22,chandler,"Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it.  Here we go.",8.4
S07E22,chandler,And there’s daddy!,8.4
S07E22,rachel,"Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!",8.4
S07E22,ross,"Yeah, I’ll get right on that.",8.4
S07E22,rachel,Oh come on Ross!!,8.4

S07E22,rachel,"Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?",8.4
S07E22,ross,Oh my God.,8.4
S07E22,rachel,"Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.",8.4
S07E22,rachel,"Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.",8.4
S07E22,rachel,"Oops sorry, my mistake.",8.4

S07E23,monica,"Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?",8.9
S07E23,rachel,"No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.",8.9
S07E23,monica,Any woman would be lucky to have ya.,8.9
S07E23,rachel,Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.,8.9
S07E23,monica,Rachel! You okay?,8.9
S07E23,joey,"Excuse me, Aaron?  Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.",8.9

S07E23,joey,"Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.",8.9
S07E23,joey,Transplant.,8.9

S07E23,joey,"Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy, we’ve got a scene to shoot!",8.9
S07E23,joey,Are you drunk?,8.9
S07E23,joey,Yes you are!,8.9
S07E23,ross,We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!,8.9
S07E23,phoebe,Oh my God! Is that him?,8.9
S07E23,ross,"That is an old, Chinese woman!",8.9
S07E23,phoebe,"He could be in disguise, y’know.",8.9
S07E23,ross,"Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?",8.9
S07E23,ross,So this is your office?,8.9
S07E23,chandler,How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!,8.9
S07E23,phoebe,What the hell are you doing?!,8.9
S07E23,chandler,Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?,8.9
S07E23,ross,"She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.",8.9
S07E23,chandler,No! No! No! I can’t do that!,8.9
S07E23,phoebe,Why not?!,8.9
S07E23,chandler,"Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!",8.9
S07E23,ross,What’s wrong with being the Bings?,8.9
S07E23,chandler,The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!,8.9
S07E23,ross,"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?",8.9
S07E23,chandler,No.,8.9
S07E23,ross,Then you are neither of your parents!,8.9
S07E23,chandler,"It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.",8.9
S07E23,phoebe,"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.",8.9
S07E23,chandler,"I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.",8.9
S07E23,ross,"Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?",8.9
S07E23,chandler,"Well yeah, but then…",8.9
S07E23,ross,"Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?",8.9
S07E23,chandler,Depends on what you mean by we.,8.9
S07E23,rachel,The nights are the hardest.  But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…,8.9
S07E23,monica,"The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!",8.9
S07E23,rachel,I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.,8.9

S08E01,chandler,"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?",8.7
S08E01,joey,"Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.",8.7
S08E01,chandler,Those aren’t eleven and a half.,8.7
S08E01,joey,"Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!",8.7
S08E01,monica,Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!,8.7
S08E01,rachel,Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?,8.7
S08E01,monica,This is so huge.,8.7
S08E01,rachel,"Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?",8.7
S08E01,monica,Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…,8.7
S08E01,rachel,Yeah.,8.7
S08E01,monica,…in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?,8.7
S08E01,rachel,"Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!",8.7
S08E01,monica,How?,8.7
S08E01,rachel,I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.,8.7
S08E01,monica,"Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.",8.7
S08E01,rachel,"Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.",8.7
S08E01,monica,Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.,8.7
S08E01,rachel,Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.,8.7
S08E01,monica,"Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?",8.7
S08E01,rachel,I don’t know.,8.7
S08E01,monica,Are you okay?,8.7
S08E01,rachel,Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.,8.7
S08E01,rachel,Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.,8.7
S08E01,phoebe,"Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…",8.7
S08E01,monica,Oh really?!,8.7
S08E01,phoebe,"Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, \James",8.7
S08E01,monica,Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.,8.7
S08E01,phoebe,Why bother?,8.7
S08E01,monica,How do you feel?,8.7
S08E01,rachel,I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make.  Somebody just take this away from me!!,8.7
S08E01,phoebe,Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.,8.7
S08E01,rachel,What?!,8.7
S08E01,phoebe,"When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.",8.7
S08E01,monica,Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?,8.7
S08E01,rachel,How many ways are there to do that?,8.7
S08E01,phoebe,"I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.",8.7
S08E01,rachel,"All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.",8.7
S08E01,monica,"You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.",8.7

S08E01,joey,No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.,8.7
S08E01,chandler,But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.,8.7
S08E01,joey,Hey!,8.7
S08E01,ross,"No-no, thank you Miranda.",8.7

S08E01,joey,"Well I’m not proud of this, but…",8.7
S08E01,monica,"Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?",8.7
S08E01,chandler,Did it turn into sand?,8.7
S08E01,monica,"Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine.",8.7
S08E01,chandler,"No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.",8.7
S08E01,monica,"Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me.  There you go.",8.7
S08E01,chandler,Why?,8.7

S08E02,joey,Hey!,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?",9.1

S08E02,chandler,Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.,9.1

S08E02,chandler,"Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?",9.1
S08E02,rachel,Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.,9.1
S08E02,chandler,Oh.,9.1
S08E02,monica,Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.,9.1
S08E02,rachel,"Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.",9.1
S08E02,chandler,"Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed.",9.1

S08E02,ross,No you didn’t.,9.1
S08E02,chandler,"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…",9.1
S08E02,ross,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, \Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?\""  Yeah",9.1
S08E02,chandler,So you don’t have the cameras?!,9.1
S08E02,ross,No. Sorry man.,9.1
S08E02,chandler,So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!,9.1

S08E02,monica,Hey!,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?,9.1
S08E02,monica,"No!  even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.,9.1
S08E02,monica,A tiny salt shaker!!!,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!,9.1
S08E02,monica,Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,Oh yeah.,9.1
S08E02,monica,"Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,Okay.,9.1
S08E02,monica,"Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.",9.1
S08E02,monica,Or this one!,9.1
S08E02,rachel,Hi.,9.1
S08E02,monica,"Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?",9.1
S08E02,rachel,Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?,9.1
S08E02,monica,No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  After you of course.",9.1
S08E02,rachel,"Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?",9.1
S08E02,rachel,Ew! No!,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,What?! I think he’s cute.,9.1
S08E02,rachel,Well then you have his baby.,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,Believe me I’m trying.,9.1
S08E02,monica,"Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.",9.1
S08E02,rachel,"Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.",9.1
S08E02,rachel,"Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!",9.1
S08E02,monica,What was that bam?,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.,9.1
S08E02,joey,Hey!,9.1
S08E02,rachel,"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?",9.1
S08E02,joey,I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!,9.1
S08E02,rachel,"Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!",9.1
S08E02,joey,Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on?  Is somebody pregnant?,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,Oh yeah. That’s me.,9.1
S08E02,joey,Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,"Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby!",9.1
S08E02,joey,"Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?",9.1
S08E02,phoebe,You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.,9.1
S08E02,joey,Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!,9.1
S08E02,phoebe,David Lynn.,9.1
S08E02,joey,David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!,9.1

S08E02,phoebe,Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.,9.1
S08E02,ross,Chandler?,9.1
S08E02,chandler,Hey! Did you find the cameras?,9.1

S08E02,chandler,"Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.",9.1
S08E02,ross,"Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?",9.1
S08E02,chandler,All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!,9.1
S08E02,ross,I’m sorry man.  Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.,9.1
S08E02,chandler,Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?,9.1
S08E02,ross,"No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.",9.1
S08E02,chandler,Are you serious?,9.1
S08E02,ross,I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?,9.1
S08E02,chandler,Marriage advice? Really?!,9.1
S08E02,ross,"I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?",9.1

S08E03,joey,"Well, what did you say to her?",8.7
S08E03,ross,Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.,8.7
S08E03,phoebe,Oh Ross.,8.7
S08E03,ross,"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.",8.7

S08E03,rachel,Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!,8.7
S08E03,ross,"Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.",8.7
S08E03,rachel,What married?,8.7
S08E03,ross,"Well yeah, I think we should get married.",8.7
S08E03,rachel,"What, because that’s your answer to everything?",8.7

S08E03,rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?",8.7
S08E03,ross,No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.,8.7

S08E03,ross,"Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.",8.7
S08E03,rachel,What?!,8.7

S08E03,rachel,"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.",8.7
S08E03,ross,"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.",8.7
S08E03,ross,I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.,8.7
S08E03,rachel,I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!,8.7

S08E04,monica,"Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?",9.3
S08E04,chandler,Was that another question?,9.3
S08E04,rachel,Hey! Is Ross still here?,9.3
S08E04,joey,"Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.",9.3
S08E04,rachel,"Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.",9.3

S08E04,ross,"Forget it, she’s destroying it.",9.3
S08E04,phoebe,"Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!",9.3
S08E04,ross,"Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.",9.3
S08E04,rachel,I wanna see it.,9.3
S08E04,ross,What?!,9.3
S08E04,rachel,"Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?",9.3
S08E04,joey,Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!,9.3
S08E04,ross,I don’t want people to see it for your sake.,9.3
S08E04,rachel,"Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me.",9.3
S08E04,ross,"Rachel, please…",9.3
S08E04,rachel,"Ah, a little preview!",9.3
S08E04,ross,"Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…",9.3
S08E04,rachel,"Okay, here we go.",9.3

S08E04,ross,"I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost…",9.3
S08E04,rachel,"Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?",9.3

S08E05,phoebe,"Well, it’s no pesto.",8.1
S08E05,monica,"All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay?  I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.",8.1
S08E05,chandler,"You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?",8.1
S08E05,chandler,What’s funny about that?,8.1
S08E05,ross,Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.,8.1

S08E05,ross,"Well, why don’t you correct him?",8.1
S08E05,chandler,"Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, \Hey Toby",8.1
S08E05,ross,Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!,8.1
S08E05,chandler,"No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel.",8.1
S08E05,ross,"Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!",8.1
S08E05,chandler,Shh! It is a family name!,8.1
S08E05,ross,"Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?",8.1
S08E05,joey,"Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.",8.1

S08E05,rachel,Hi.,8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.  And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm.",8.1
S08E05,joey,NA,8.1

S08E05,monica,I…I have to fire him.,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,But why?!,8.1
S08E05,monica,"Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.",8.1
S08E05,monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",8.1
S08E05,monica,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.",8.1
S08E05,monica,I paid to have this done.,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,Love it!,8.1
S08E05,joey,Hey!,8.1
S08E05,rachel,Hi!,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",8.1
S08E05,rachel,I thought I was a complete idiot.,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.",8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?",8.1
S08E05,joey,I said no.,8.1
S08E05,rachel,What?!,8.1
S08E05,joey,What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.,8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",8.1
S08E05,joey,I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?",8.1
S08E05,joey,"Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…",8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!",8.1
S08E05,chandler,Hey Bob.,8.1
S08E05,chandler,"If I see him, I’ll ask.",8.1
S08E05,chandler,Yeah!,8.1
S08E05,chandler,We’re on a semi-first name basis.,8.1
S08E05,chandler,"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.",8.1
S08E05,chandler,But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.,8.1
S08E05,chandler,I think it’s best sir.,8.1
S08E05,chandler,"Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.",8.1
S08E05,chandler,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,Hey!,8.1
S08E05,monica,"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,But…,8.1
S08E05,monica,"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, \Ha-ha! Gotcha!\""",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",8.1
S08E05,monica,Why not?!,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,Because I’m dumping him today.,8.1
S08E05,monica,What?! You said he was sweet!,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.  \So did-did you get home from work okay?\"" \""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?\""",8.1
S08E05,monica,Just don’t pick up your phone.,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"Then he comes over!  \I’m so worried about you.\"" Uck! Be a man!""",8.1
S08E05,monica,What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",8.1
S08E05,monica,"Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!",8.1
S08E05,monica,"Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!",8.1
S08E05,phoebe,Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,8.1
S08E05,monica,What do you mean?,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!",8.1
S08E05,monica,I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.,8.1
S08E05,phoebe,"All right, that makes sense.",8.1
S08E05,chandler,"Sure, what’s up?",8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. \Umm",8.1

S08E05,rachel,Hi!,8.1
S08E05,joey,Hey!,8.1

S08E05,joey,No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.,8.1
S08E05,ross,Rach? You wanna come?,8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.",8.1
S08E05,ross,A date?,8.1
S08E05,rachel,Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?,8.1
S08E05,ross,"Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.",8.1
S08E05,joey,It’s no Ukrainian film.,8.1
S08E05,rachel,Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!,8.1
S08E05,ross,A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?,8.1
S08E05,joey,I set her up with this actor on my show.,8.1
S08E05,ross,You set her up?!,8.1
S08E05,joey,No,8.1
S08E05,ross,Joey what-what were you thinking?!,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!",8.1
S08E05,ross,"Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?",8.1
S08E05,joey,Hey! I’m an  actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.,8.1
S08E05,ross,A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,8.1
S08E05,joey,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,8.1
S08E05,ross,Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.",8.1
S08E05,ross,Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.,8.1

S08E05,phoebe,Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.,8.1
S08E05,joey,So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.,8.1
S08E05,ross,Books?,8.1
S08E05,joey,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!",8.1
S08E05,ross,"Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.",8.1
S08E05,joey,And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?,8.1
S08E05,ross,"Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.",8.1
S08E05,joey,Dude! What is going on?!,8.1
S08E05,ross,I just…I have to find out how it went.,8.1
S08E05,joey,Why?,8.1
S08E05,ross,This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!,8.1
S08E05,joey,They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!,8.1
S08E05,ross,I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?",8.1
S08E05,ross,I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.,8.1
S08E05,joey,What do you mean?,8.1
S08E05,ross,"It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.",8.1
S08E05,joey,That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,8.1
S08E05,ross,No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",8.1
S08E05,ross,It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.",8.1
S08E05,ross,No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,8.1
S08E05,joey,"I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.",8.1
S08E05,ross,"No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.",8.1
S08E05,joey,"That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",8.1
S08E05,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S08E05,joey,"Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",8.1
S08E05,ross,We can still catch that Ukrainian film.,8.1

S08E05,phoebe,"Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.",8.1
S08E05,monica,Tim wait!,8.1
S08E05,monica,"Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.",8.1

S08E05,ross,"Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?",8.1
S08E05,rachel,"Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.",8.1
S08E05,ross,Oh?,8.1
S08E05,rachel,"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, \Yeah",8.1

S08E05,rachel,Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.,8.1
S08E05,ross,"Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.",8.1

S08E06,phoebe,I love the second grade!,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,"Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day.",8.5
S08E06,phoebe,No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.,8.5

S08E06,joey,"Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.",8.5
S08E06,chandler,What question?,8.5
S08E06,joey,"Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?",8.5
S08E06,chandler,There’s no question.,8.5
S08E06,joey,So you think Ross too?,8.5
S08E06,chandler,You picked Ross?!,8.5

S08E06,chandler,I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.,8.5
S08E06,ross,"Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.",8.5
S08E06,chandler,Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?,8.5
S08E06,ross,Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!,8.5
S08E06,monica,"Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop!  Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.",8.5
S08E06,joey,"Hey Monica!  People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!",8.5
S08E06,joey,Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.,8.5
S08E06,chandler,You’re going down.,8.5

S08E06,rachel,No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,8.5
S08E06,monica,"Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!",8.5
S08E06,chandler,That means nothing to me.  Come on!,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,Hi liar!,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,But they’re not!,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,Why are you lying to him?,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!,8.5

S08E06,chandler,"God, I’m exhausted.",8.5

S08E06,chandler,No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!,8.5
S08E06,ross,"Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.",8.5
S08E06,chandler,You’re Spudnik.,8.5
S08E06,ross,"Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.",8.5
S08E06,chandler,Fine.  Oh no!,8.5

S08E06,phoebe,Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.,8.5
S08E06,phoebe,"She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me.  Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?",8.5
S08E06,phoebe,"Oh, I almost don’t want to show this.  Just remember I’m a minute younger.",8.5
S08E06,phoebe,"No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.",8.5
S08E06,phoebe,"That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person.  What?",8.5
S08E06,phoebe,"Yeah, you should.",8.5
S08E06,joey,Hey!,8.5
S08E06,rachel,"Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.",8.5
S08E06,joey,That’s not so bad.,8.5
S08E06,rachel,"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!",8.5
S08E06,joey,"Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!",8.5
S08E06,rachel,Really? You think that’s all it is?,8.5
S08E06,joey,"Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.",8.5
S08E06,monica,"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",8.5
S08E06,chandler,"Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.",8.5
S08E06,monica,Is that a secret or a lie.,8.5
S08E06,chandler,"No, I let him win—Ross!",8.5
S08E06,ross,Yeah?,8.5
S08E06,chandler,Would you tell her I let you win please?,8.5
S08E06,ross,Oh. Yeah.,8.5
S08E06,chandler,I am strong! I’ll show you!,8.5

S08E06,chandler,Okay. 1…2…3—Go!  I’m gonna kill myself!,8.5
S08E07,monica,Hey.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Hey.,7.9
S08E07,monica,"Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!",7.9
S08E07,chandler,"Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.",7.9
S08E07,monica,"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?",7.9
S08E07,chandler,"No, it wasn’t you.",7.9
S08E07,monica,Well then who?,7.9
S08E07,chandler,I got a maid. Yay!,7.9
S08E07,monica,"I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…",7.9
S08E07,chandler,"Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…",7.9
S08E07,monica,"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!",7.9
S08E07,chandler,"Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",7.9
S08E07,monica,Did she really say that?,7.9
S08E07,chandler,"Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?",7.9
S08E07,monica,"Fine, I can do it.  Whew.",7.9
S08E07,chandler,What’s the matter?,7.9
S08E07,monica,"Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.,7.9
S08E07,ross,I think it’s coming from your bag.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Hello?,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Oh you did?  He did it! He did it!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Wow! What did he do?,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Shhh! I’m talking.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.",7.9
S08E07,ross,So apparently I’m available for lunch.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.,7.9
S08E07,ross,You’re moving?,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be,  \How you doin’?\""",7.9
S08E07,ross,So does-does Joey know you’re moving?,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",7.9
S08E07,ross,That’s not really porn.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Not so much.,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Yeah that would really be great.,7.9
S08E07,ross,Yeah.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.,7.9
S08E07,ross,Yeah. No. No you’re right.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Shall we?,7.9
S08E07,ross,Yeah.,7.9
S08E07,ross,Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.",7.9
S08E07,ross,I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.,7.9
S08E07,ross,What?,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Oh, thank God!",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Ahh.,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in",7.9
S08E07,ross,Y’know I would it’s just painful.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,So she’s really not dead.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",7.9
S08E07,monica,"Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.",7.9
S08E07,monica,I love her.,7.9
S08E07,monica,Okay.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,See? I told you.,7.9
S08E07,monica,She stole my jeans!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,What?,7.9
S08E07,monica,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,7.9
S08E07,monica,Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,She must’ve been planning this for years!,7.9
S08E07,monica,I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,"Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",7.9
S08E07,monica,I guess.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,"So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?",7.9
S08E07,monica,Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",7.9
S08E07,monica,Yeah!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Hi!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Oh.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Yeah.  Yeah.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Maybe this is too weird.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,No don’t tear out your eyes!!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Oh, yeah try that.  So, is that better?",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Look Eric, turn around.",7.9
S08E07,ross,"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",7.9
S08E07,ross,"Yeah, we’re done.",7.9
S08E07,ross,Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?,7.9
S08E07,joey,"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",7.9
S08E07,ross,Really?!,7.9
S08E07,joey,"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",7.9
S08E07,ross,Sweet!,7.9
S08E07,joey,"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",7.9
S08E07,ross,Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,7.9
S08E07,joey,"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!",7.9
S08E07,ross,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",7.9
S08E07,joey,"Oh, you’re switching apartments?",7.9
S08E07,ross,"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",7.9
S08E07,joey,But Rachel has an apartment.,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",7.9
S08E07,joey,She is?,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?",7.9
S08E07,joey,I guess I didn’t really think about it.,7.9
S08E07,ross,Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!,7.9
S08E07,ross,Damnit!,7.9
S08E07,monica,Nice jeans!,7.9
S08E07,monica,Oh.  You’re not gettin’ it.,7.9
S08E07,monica,"Oh, I fell asleep.",7.9
S08E07,monica,"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.",7.9
S08E07,monica,Hello.,7.9
S08E07,monica,"I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Hey!,7.9
S08E07,joey,Hey!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,How was the game?,7.9
S08E07,joey,"Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Oh.,7.9
S08E07,joey,"Ooh.  So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,7.9
S08E07,joey,I was kinda hoping you’d stay.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.",7.9
S08E07,joey,No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.",7.9
S08E07,joey,I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",7.9
S08E07,joey,I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,I know.,7.9
S08E07,joey,Y’know I blame Ross for this.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,I do too a little bit.,7.9
S08E07,joey,"I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.",7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Hi!,7.9
S08E07,monica,"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",7.9
S08E07,chandler,How come?,7.9
S08E07,monica,Because I put my head between her legs.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,To see her pants?,7.9
S08E07,monica,They’re my pants!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,7.9
S08E07,monica,No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",7.9
S08E07,monica,Fine.  She’s wearing my bra!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Oh dear God!,7.9
S08E07,monica,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.,7.9
S08E07,monica,Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Here’s another plan…No!,7.9
S08E07,monica,I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Why?,7.9
S08E07,monica,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,I fear a jury will see it the same way!,7.9
S08E07,monica,"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!",7.9
S08E07,chandler,You see that?,7.9
S08E07,monica,Do you see this?,7.9
S08E07,chandler,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,7.9
S08E07,monica,"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.",7.9
S08E07,chandler,You need new clothes.,7.9
S08E07,ross,Hi. How is she?,7.9
S08E07,ross,NA,7.9
S08E07,ross,Oh I don’t know that it would.,7.9
S08E07,ross,All right then.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Hey!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Why?,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,What sex?,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,We didn’t have sex.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,So I guess this is it.,7.9
S08E07,phoebe,"Yeah, so do you.",7.9
S08E07,chandler,I’m leaning. This is where I lean.,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Brenda a bee!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,7.9
S08E07,chandler,You do?,7.9
S08E07,chandler,I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Hi!,7.9
S08E07,monica,Where did you get those jeans?!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,You gave them to me!,7.9
S08E07,monica,No I didn’t!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",7.9
S08E07,monica,Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,What bra?,7.9
S08E07,monica,The pink one with the flowers?!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,You mean the one that you’re wearing?,7.9
S08E07,monica,Sounds about right.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,What is this?,7.9
S08E07,joey,"Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?",7.9
S08E07,rachel,You’re so sweet.,7.9
S08E07,joey,Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion?,7.9
S08E07,rachel,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.",7.9
S08E07,joey,I’m loud!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,It’s gonna be up all night!,7.9
S08E07,joey,I’m up all night!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,It’s gonna poop!,7.9
S08E07,joey,Hello!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,What about all the women you want to bring home?,7.9
S08E07,joey,"Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",7.9
S08E07,rachel,"Joey, are you sure?",7.9
S08E07,joey,"Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",7.9
S08E07,rachel,I want me to stay too.,7.9
S08E07,joey,Ohh!,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!,7.9

S08E07,rachel,Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.,7.9
S08E07,joey,Yeah.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?,7.9
S08E07,joey,I don’t know.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,It’s moving.,7.9
S08E07,joey,Ew.,7.9
S08E07,rachel,It’s still——It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!,7.9
S08E07,joey,Ooh! Ah! Okay!,7.9
S08E07,ross,"Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care,  because you got the apartment. Yes!",7.9
S08E07,rachel,Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.,7.9
S08E07,joey,Isn’t that great?,7.9
S08E07,ross,Ezels!!,7.9
S08E08,rachel,Hey Pheebs?,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Huh?,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Oh. Why not?,8.8
S08E08,rachel,‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’",8.8
S08E08,rachel,What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Wow! Oh well, I will be there!",8.8
S08E08,rachel,Thank you.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.,8.8
S08E08,monica,No you don’t!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,No you don’t.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,Her what?!!,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Your secret bachelorette party…,8.8
S08E08,chandler,You had a bachelorette party?!,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,"I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",8.8
S08E08,joey,It’s a grand tradition!,8.8
S08E08,monica,"I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",8.8
S08E08,rachel,Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.,8.8
S08E08,joey,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",8.8
S08E08,chandler,You went home with the waitress.,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Yeah, I don’t eat that either.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,Well actually umm…,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Rachel!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Hey, that is the…baby’s problem.  Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Well… Umm, I got TiVo.",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,It’s slang for pregnant.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,Phoebe!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross.  Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!",8.8
S08E08,rachel,Yeah.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,Who?,8.8
S08E08,rachel,February 2nd!,8.8
S08E08,ross,Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.,8.8
S08E08,ross,"Yeah, a lot of my students do that.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"Okay, bye.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,My God! You must be good in bed!,8.8
S08E08,joey,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?",8.8
S08E08,ross,"Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great. She’s, she’s so…",8.8
S08E08,joey,Hot?,8.8
S08E08,ross,"Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!",8.8
S08E08,chandler,She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?,8.8
S08E08,ross,"Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.",8.8
S08E08,joey,I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,What?,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",8.8
S08E08,chandler,Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…,8.8
S08E08,joey,Will you let the lady talk?!,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.",8.8
S08E08,monica,"So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!",8.8
S08E08,monica,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!,8.8
S08E08,joey,Yeah!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,And Joey.,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",8.8
S08E08,joey,I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.",8.8
S08E08,phoebe,It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,Yeah?,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!!  Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,I’m sorry daddy.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",8.8
S08E08,joey,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?",8.8
S08E08,chandler,What are you doing?,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.,8.8
S08E08,joey,How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,8.8
S08E08,chandler,"You’re right, this is more fun.",8.8
S08E08,joey,"That’s her! Okay, come on!",8.8
S08E08,chandler,Hi.,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!",8.8
S08E08,chandler,That’s me.,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Yeah, yeah right over there.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,That was weird.,8.8
S08E08,joey,Why-why would she go in the bedroom?,8.8
S08E08,chandler,So she’s a…,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!",8.8
S08E08,ross,Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.,8.8
S08E08,ross,So much more.,8.8
S08E08,ross,"Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One.",8.8
S08E08,ross,Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.,8.8
S08E08,ross,Who did?!,8.8
S08E08,ross,"Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.",8.8
S08E08,ross,Hey! I offered to marry her!,8.8
S08E08,ross,But I didn’t want to.,8.8
S08E08,ross,"I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?",8.8
S08E08,joey,"Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.",8.8
S08E08,joey,I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",8.8
S08E08,ross,"I was going to tell you, but…",8.8
S08E08,ross,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?,8.8
S08E08,joey,Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.,8.8
S08E08,ross,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.",8.8
S08E08,monica,Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.,8.8
S08E08,monica,My husband.,8.8
S08E08,monica,She’s a stripper.,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",8.8
S08E08,monica,Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?,8.8
S08E08,joey,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,8.8
S08E08,chandler,Why would she do that?,8.8
S08E08,joey,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",8.8
S08E08,chandler,This is the worst bachelor party ever!,8.8
S08E08,joey,In a minute!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!,8.8
S08E08,joey,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,Why me?!,8.8
S08E08,joey,Hey! It’s your bachelor party.,8.8
S08E08,chandler,Which is why you should do it.,8.8
S08E08,joey,I don’t want to. You do it!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,You do it!,8.8
S08E08,joey,You do it!,8.8
S08E08,chandler,"All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?",8.8
S08E08,joey,I miss this.,8.8
S08E08,chandler,I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!,8.8
S08E08,joey,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,Well we…we still hang out.,8.8
S08E08,joey,Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.,8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.",8.8
S08E08,joey,"Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?",8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.",8.8
S08E08,joey,You got it. Come here.,8.8
S08E08,monica,NA,8.8
S08E08,ross,So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,Oh no…,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",8.8
S08E08,ross,I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?",8.8
S08E08,ross,Rachel!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.",8.8
S08E08,ross,Okay!,8.8
S08E08,rachel,Okay.,8.8
S08E08,ross,Thank you!,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! \We were on a break!\"" \""No we weren’t!\"" What happened to you two?!""",8.8
S08E08,ross,Thank you so much for coming back over.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.",8.8
S08E08,ross,Focus.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!,8.8
S08E08,ross,Yeah.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",8.8
S08E08,ross,Trying to date this woman.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.",8.8
S08E08,ross,Probably shouldn’t touch me.,8.8
S08E08,rachel,"I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?",8.8
S08E08,ross,Should I leave this open for you too?,8.8
S08E08,ross,Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.,8.8
S08E08,ross,"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!",8.8
S08E08,rachel,NA,8.8
S08E08,monica,I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?,8.8
S08E08,chandler,"Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?",8.8
S08E08,monica,Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper,8.8
S08E08,chandler,Monica! Wait!,8.8
S08E08,monica,What?,8.8
S08E08,chandler,Carry on.,8.8
S08E08,monica,"Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off.",8.8
S08E08,chandler,Could you not narrate?,8.8
S08E08,monica,Gotcha sailor.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,"Wow, you told your dad the truth.",8.8
S08E08,rachel,About an hour ago.,8.8
S08E08,phoebe,Wanna go see a movie?,8.8
S08E08,rachel,Yes!,8.8
S08E08,joey,Stupid guy on my phone.,8.8
S08E09,joey,"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,NA,9.3
S08E09,joey,You fall for it every time!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Hey!,9.3

S08E09,monica,"Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?",9.3
S08E09,rachel,No.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",9.3
S08E09,monica,"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time…  Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,Oh that’s nice.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous!  I still love Chandler.",9.3
S08E09,joey,I just want you to say it once in a while.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.",9.3
S08E09,joey,What?!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…,9.3
S08E09,joey,Phoebe!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!",9.3
S08E09,joey,No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!,9.3
S08E09,monica,"All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.",9.3
S08E09,joey,She is?,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,9.3
S08E09,joey,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",9.3
S08E09,joey,"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",9.3
S08E09,monica,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,9.3
S08E09,joey,No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!,9.3
S08E09,monica,"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",9.3
S08E09,joey,"That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",9.3
S08E09,monica,"Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table?  Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Hey!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Hey!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Happy Thanksgiving!,9.3
S08E09,monica,You too!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Anything I can do to help?,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Sure!,9.3
S08E09,monica,I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Okay.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.  So how’s the game?",9.3
S08E09,chandler,I have no idea.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,What?,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.,9.3
S08E09,monica,Is your team winning hon?,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There’s no Anderson.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.",9.3
S08E09,monica,"Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Well normally I don’t, but y’know……Green Bay is playing.",9.3
S08E09,monica,You like Green Bay?,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }",9.3
S08E09,monica,Hey!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…,9.3
S08E09,monica,A pie!,9.3
S08E09,monica,"You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.",9.3
S08E09,chandler,"Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.",9.3
S08E09,monica,This is Phoebe.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Well done.,9.3
S08E09,monica,Wanna give me a hand?,9.3
S08E09,monica,Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!,9.3
S08E09,chandler,"I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!",9.3
S08E09,monica,"Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.",9.3
S08E09,monica,Good. And Rachel Green too.,9.3
S08E09,monica,Is there a problem?,9.3
S08E09,monica,What?,9.3
S08E09,chandler,"Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Oh okay.,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Oh come on!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.",9.3
S08E09,joey,Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.,9.3
S08E09,monica,All right.,9.3
S08E09,joey,"Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.",9.3
S08E09,joey,Who the hell is this guy?,9.3
S08E09,monica,Will! From high school.,9.3
S08E09,joey,Oh hey!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Joey.,9.3
S08E09,ross,Will!,9.3
S08E09,ross,Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff!  Hot stuff?,9.3
S08E09,ross,"Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?",9.3
S08E09,ross,Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.,9.3
S08E09,ross,"Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’ graduation party.",9.3
S08E09,ross,"Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.",9.3
S08E09,ross,Yeah.,9.3
S08E09,ross,Yeah.,9.3
S08E09,ross,So how long are you in town?,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Hi!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Hey sweetie. Oh good.,9.3
S08E09,ross,"Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?",9.3
S08E09,ross,"Will, high school was-was a long time ago.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Oh my God Monica, who is that?",9.3
S08E09,monica,That’s Will from high school!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on.",9.3
S08E09,monica,"Okay, dinner’s ready!",9.3
S08E09,chandler,Good game!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Yeah.,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Oh, so who won?",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Green Bay.,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Detroit.,9.3
S08E09,monica,What?,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Hi! Will, right?",9.3
S08E09,rachel,Hi! I’m Rachel Green.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?",9.3
S08E09,rachel,Thank you!,9.3
S08E09,monica,NA,9.3
S08E09,joey,That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!,9.3
S08E09,monica,NA,9.3
S08E09,joey,Oh. How-how big is that?,9.3
S08E09,monica,About nineteen pounds.,9.3
S08E09,joey,It’s like me when I was born.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?",9.3
S08E09,rachel,What?  Oh y’know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,I’m sorry. What?,9.3
S08E09,joey,"Seriously, who is this guy?",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,I think you do.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…,9.3
S08E09,monica,Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…,9.3
S08E09,monica,Okay.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…",9.3
S08E09,rachel,You had a club?!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?",9.3
S08E09,ross,"No need to point, she knows who Ross is.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?,9.3
S08E09,ross,No. No.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,So who else was in this club?,9.3
S08E09,ross,"Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.",9.3
S08E09,ross,That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Okay Monica, did you know about this?!",9.3
S08E09,monica,I swear I didn’t.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.",9.3
S08E09,ross,"Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…",9.3
S08E09,ross,…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?,9.3
S08E09,ross,No-no! No-no. No-no.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,What?! What else did you do?,9.3
S08E09,rachel,What rumor?,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!",9.3
S08E09,rachel,Ross!,9.3
S08E09,ross,It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,What?!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Oh my God!,9.3
S08E09,monica,You started that?!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,What?! You heard that?!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Everyone at our school heard it!,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!,9.3
S08E09,ross,"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Monica, how come you never told me this?!",9.3
S08E09,monica,I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!,9.3
S08E09,joey,I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Oh!,9.3
S08E09,joey,You are my Everest.,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Joey, you don’t have to finish that.",9.3
S08E09,joey,"Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, \Dear Rach",9.3
S08E09,ross,"Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,NA,9.3
S08E09,ross,"Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!",9.3
S08E09,rachel,Yes!,9.3
S08E09,monica,Oh! Me too!,9.3
S08E09,ross,Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.,9.3
S08E09,monica,That’s not totally true.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,What?,9.3
S08E09,ross,What?,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.",9.3
S08E09,ross,How did you know that?!!!!,9.3
S08E09,monica,It’s true?!!,9.3
S08E09,ross,No.,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!,9.3
S08E09,chandler,I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?,9.3
S08E09,ross,Hey! She didn’t look 50!,9.3
S08E09,chandler,Did she look 16?,9.3
S08E09,rachel,"Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Oh!  Wow!,9.3
S08E09,ross,She didn’t photograph well!,9.3
S08E09,chandler,"Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?",9.3
S08E09,ross,"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…",9.3
S08E09,monica,Didn’t she walk with a cane?,9.3
S08E09,ross,Only when it was damp!!  I’m back in the club!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,I wanna join!,9.3
S08E09,rachel,Wh—Phoebe!!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,"All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!",9.3
S08E09,monica,"All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",9.3
S08E09,rachel,Wow…,9.3
S08E09,monica,"And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",9.3
S08E09,ross,As a romancer of the elderly.,9.3
S08E09,monica,Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.,9.3
S08E09,ross,The eyes…did still sparkle.,9.3
S08E09,monica,Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?,9.3
S08E09,rachel,She’s right.,9.3
S08E09,ross,Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.,9.3
S08E09,ross,Yeah.,9.3
S08E09,ross,Nope.,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Okay.  It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.,9.3
S08E09,joey,All right where’s that turkey!,9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!,9.3
S08E09,joey,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!,9.3
S08E09,joey,Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew!,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.",9.3
S08E09,chandler,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",9.3
S08E09,phoebe,Is there anything we can do for you?,9.3
S08E09,joey,"No just, nobody press on my stomach.",9.3
S08E09,rachel,You can keep those pants by the way.,9.3
S08E09,joey,Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?,9.3
S08E09,monica,"Yeah, you want some?",9.3
S08E09,joey,"Ah, just cut me a little sliver.  What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!",9.3
S08E10,monica,Hey! So what do you think?,8.1
S08E10,chandler,New haircut?  Boots!,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on boots…or rent",8.1
S08E10,chandler,Oh my God!,8.1
S08E10,monica,I know.,8.1
S08E10,chandler,I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.,8.1
S08E10,monica,"I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, \Oh",8.1
S08E10,chandler,She had a point.,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Hi!,8.1
S08E10,monica,Hey.,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Oh my God!  Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!,8.1
S08E10,monica,They’re mine!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?",8.1
S08E10,chandler,I have you.,8.1
S08E10,monica,Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.,8.1
S08E10,ross,"That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?,8.1
S08E10,rachel,He’s talking to the baby.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, \I can’t wait to hear your first words",8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Okay.,8.1
S08E10,ross,Bye.,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Bye.,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Hi.,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…",8.1
S08E10,rachel,"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.",8.1
S08E10,joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.",8.1
S08E10,rachel,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Okay, so will you meet with her?",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Yeah.,8.1
S08E10,joey,She took ‘em!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?,8.1
S08E10,ross,Yeah. Why?,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Sting has a son that goes there too!,8.1
S08E10,ross,Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!,8.1
S08E10,ross,Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.",8.1
S08E10,ross,What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?",8.1
S08E10,ross,"Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.",8.1
S08E10,ross,"Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!",8.1
S08E10,monica,Hey guys!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,Hey-hey.,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Hi Monica!,8.1
S08E10,monica,Hey.,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Hi boots.,8.1
S08E10,monica,"See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…",8.1
S08E10,chandler,You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Wow! They’re beautiful!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Ahh…,8.1
S08E10,monica,They hurt so much!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,What?!,8.1
S08E10,monica,The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!,8.1
S08E10,monica,"I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Well then get your money back and return them!,8.1
S08E10,monica,I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.,8.1
S08E10,ross,Hey!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,Hey!,8.1
S08E10,ross,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…,8.1
S08E10,chandler,I don’t think you did a very thorough job!,8.1
S08E10,ross,"I dropped him off at Carol’s.  Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Oh no! Why not?,8.1
S08E10,ross,Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,How come?!,8.1
S08E10,ross,"Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.,8.1
S08E10,ross,"Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!",8.1
S08E10,ross,Playpen?! Ben’s seven!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Your kid is seven?!  Please! Please get the tickets!,8.1
S08E10,ross,"Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Yes you can! Sting says so himself!,8.1
S08E10,ross,What?,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Rosssss can!,8.1
S08E10,ross,"Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Rossss can!,8.1
S08E10,ross,"Phoebe, I…",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!,8.1

S08E10,rachel,"Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…",8.1
S08E10,joey,My little sister Dina!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Right! Hi Dina!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Nice to meet you.,8.1
S08E10,joey,"This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business.",8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…",8.1
S08E10,rachel,And there’s marketing…,8.1
S08E10,monica,Ahhhhhhhh!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,What’s wrong?,8.1
S08E10,monica,Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning.,8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight.",8.1
S08E10,monica,"Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?",8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.",8.1
S08E10,monica,I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.,8.1
S08E10,chandler,Why not?,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!",8.1
S08E10,chandler,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.",8.1
S08E10,chandler,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!",8.1
S08E10,monica,"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.",8.1
S08E10,chandler,Okay.,8.1
S08E10,monica,Okay?,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for.",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Okay.,8.1
S08E10,joey,Hey! It’s my fashion girls!  What’s wrong?,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.",8.1
S08E10,joey,"Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?",8.1
S08E10,joey,Is that a sandwich?!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?,8.1
S08E10,joey,What?!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,NA,8.1
S08E10,joey,Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,What?! Dina…,8.1
S08E10,joey,I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!,8.1
S08E10,joey,"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!",8.1
S08E10,joey,I can’t look at you right now!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,I know.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Oh, there you are Ben!",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Him you’re friends with.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Oh.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.",8.1
S08E10,monica,Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,"I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",8.1
S08E10,monica,"Oh no, we can’t walk!",8.1
S08E10,chandler,"What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.",8.1
S08E10,monica,Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,8.1
S08E10,chandler,What’s going on?,8.1
S08E10,monica,I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,What?,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!",8.1
S08E10,chandler,So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.,8.1
S08E10,monica,How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,8.1
S08E10,chandler,Hop on.,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…",8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.",8.1
S08E10,rachel,What college was that Dina?,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Joey, what are you doing?",8.1
S08E10,joey,"Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…",8.1
S08E10,rachel,Oh Joey this is crazy!,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…",8.1
S08E10,joey,Oh you’ll take ‘em!,8.1
S08E10,joey,Hey! You don’t get a say in this!,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Ahhh! I heard \I do\""",8.1
S08E10,rachel,"All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",8.1
S08E10,joey,Well what am I supposed to do?,8.1
S08E10,rachel,You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,8.1
S08E10,joey,No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Oh, come on kids! A little help here!",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Wow! This place is incredible!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Hi!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Why else would I be here?,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Yeah.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,The Police? Here? A reunion?!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",8.1
S08E10,monica,Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!,8.1
S08E10,chandler,Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?,8.1
S08E10,monica,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?,8.1
S08E10,chandler,I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.,8.1
S08E10,monica,"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",8.1
S08E10,chandler,I don’t have your boots.,8.1
S08E10,monica,Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?,8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!",8.1
S08E10,monica,"Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them!",8.1
S08E10,chandler,"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?",8.1
S08E10,monica,"Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.",8.1
S08E10,chandler,Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.,8.1
S08E10,monica,Okay.  All right.,8.1
S08E10,chandler,Okay.,8.1
S08E10,monica,NA,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",8.1
S08E10,joey,"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",8.1
S08E10,joey,You were right. He is funny.,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?",8.1
S08E10,rachel,NA,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that’s not a compliment!",8.1
S08E10,joey,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,8.1
S08E10,joey,No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.,8.1
S08E10,joey,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",8.1
S08E10,rachel,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",8.1
S08E10,joey,Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!,8.1
S08E10,joey,"Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.",8.1
S08E10,joey,Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!,8.1
S08E10,joey,That’s right! By his uncle too!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,"Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment.",8.1
S08E10,joey,Come here!,8.1
S08E10,rachel,No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!,8.1
S08E10,ross,You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!,8.1
S08E10,ross,Well…let’s just say…  Rosss caaaaan!,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Oo, where are the seats?",8.1
S08E10,ross,"Uh, middle balcony.",8.1
S08E10,phoebe,"Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?",8.1
S08E10,ross,Yeah.,8.1
S08E10,phoebe,Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!,8.1
S08E11,rachel,Phoebe?,8
S08E11,phoebe,Yeah?,8
S08E11,rachel,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",8
S08E11,phoebe,"He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.",8
S08E11,rachel,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",8
S08E11,phoebe,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",8
S08E11,rachel,Yeah.,8
S08E11,phoebe,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",8
S08E11,rachel,Really?! So this has happened to you?,8
S08E11,phoebe,"Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",8
S08E11,rachel,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.",8
S08E11,phoebe,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.",8
S08E11,rachel,Ah.,8
S08E11,phoebe,Yeah.,8
S08E11,rachel,"Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.",8
S08E11,phoebe,"Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.",8
S08E11,ross,Hi!,8
S08E11,ross,"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?",8
S08E11,joey,"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",8
S08E11,ross,Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,8
S08E11,joey,I’m missin’ picture time?!,8
S08E11,phoebe,Y’know she has a face Ross!,8
S08E11,ross,"Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.",8
S08E11,ross,Together? Like-like to people?,8
S08E11,ross,Okay.,8
S08E11,ross,"Uh sure, sure.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Bye.,8
S08E11,joey,Congratulations! You just got married!,8
S08E11,ross,I know. Can you believe that?,8
S08E11,phoebe,"Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?",8
S08E11,ross,"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!",8
S08E11,joey,"Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!",8
S08E11,chandler,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?",8
S08E11,monica,"Yes, hi.",8
S08E11,chandler,"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",8
S08E11,monica,No leg-chewing for us sir.,8
S08E11,monica,I can’t think of anything we’re doing.  Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?,8
S08E11,monica,"Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow!  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?",8
S08E11,chandler,No.,8
S08E11,monica,That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.,8
S08E11,chandler,"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?",8
S08E11,ross,Hey!,8
S08E11,ross,"Huh. Wow, this is great.",8
S08E11,ross,"Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.",8
S08E11,ross,"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.",8
S08E11,ross,"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.",8
S08E11,ross,Yeah.,8
S08E11,ross,Huh.,8
S08E11,ross,Hmm…,8
S08E11,ross,Let’s do the card!,8
S08E11,ross,The card! I think we’re there!,8
S08E11,ross,"Really?! I mean, even with the card?",8
S08E11,rachel,Hi!,8
S08E11,rachel,"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers…",8
S08E11,rachel,"Yes, you are.",8
S08E11,rachel,"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?",8
S08E11,rachel,"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",8
S08E11,rachel,"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",8
S08E11,rachel,No. I’m very comfortable.,8
S08E11,rachel,"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",8
S08E11,rachel,Well would you like me to lie down on the table?,8
S08E11,rachel,Do you feel it too?,8
S08E11,rachel,Hi.,8
S08E11,phoebe,"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?",8
S08E11,rachel,"Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Oh my God.,8
S08E11,monica,Why did you do that?,8
S08E11,phoebe,"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?",8
S08E11,monica,"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.",8
S08E11,phoebe,You wish.,8
S08E11,monica,"Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Oh yeah? Come and get it.,8
S08E11,rachel,"Okay, even this is turning me on!",8
S08E11,ross,Hey!,8
S08E11,rachel,"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?",8
S08E11,ross,"Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!",8
S08E11,monica,You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?,8
S08E11,ross,"Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Ugh! Women!,8
S08E11,ross,"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, \So",8
S08E11,rachel,Uh Ross? You asked me that.,8
S08E11,ross,"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",8
S08E11,monica,Like asking her to move in with you?,8
S08E11,ross,Smaller than that.,8
S08E11,monica,Making her a mixed tape?,8
S08E11,ross,"Uh, bigger than that.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Give her a key to your apartment.,8
S08E11,ross,Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.,8
S08E11,monica,"All right. Have you said, \I love you?\"" You could say",8
S08E11,ross,"Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.",8
S08E11,phoebe,"No, we hate that.",8
S08E11,monica,That is a slap in the face.,8
S08E11,ross,"Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?",8
S08E11,rachel,"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.",8
S08E11,chandler,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.",8
S08E11,chandler,Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,8
S08E11,chandler,It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,8
S08E11,chandler,Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.,8
S08E11,chandler,Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,8
S08E11,chandler,Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,8
S08E11,chandler,"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",8
S08E11,ross,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",8
S08E11,ross,"Aw, we-we are so…",8
S08E11,ross,"I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?",8
S08E11,ross,"Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.",8
S08E11,ross,But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment.,8
S08E11,ross,Really.,8
S08E11,rachel,You gave her a key to your apartment?!,8
S08E11,ross,"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?,8
S08E11,ross,"Oh great, I live on the street.",8
S08E11,phoebe,Where?!,8
S08E11,rachel,Hey!,8
S08E11,phoebe,"Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.",8
S08E11,monica,Hi Roger.,8
S08E11,phoebe,"So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks.  Would you help me out?",8
S08E11,rachel,Yeah.,8
S08E11,phoebe,"Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.",8
S08E11,rachel,What?,8
S08E11,phoebe,You’re welcome.,8
S08E11,rachel,Phoebe no!,8
S08E11,phoebe,"It’s okay, he’s a virgin.",8
S08E11,monica,"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.",8
S08E11,phoebe,"Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.",8
S08E11,rachel,"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!",8
S08E11,phoebe,Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,8
S08E11,chandler,"Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.",8
S08E11,chandler,It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.,8
S08E11,chandler,Oh no-no-no!,8
S08E11,ross,"Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.",8
S08E11,ross,No. That guy is.,8
S08E11,ross,I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.,8
S08E11,ross,I love you!,8
S08E11,chandler,Hi honey I’m home.,8
S08E11,monica,From the tequila factory?,8
S08E11,chandler,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",8
S08E11,monica,Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,8
S08E11,chandler,"Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.",8
S08E11,monica,"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?",8
S08E11,chandler,"Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.",8
S08E11,rachel,"Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.  I’ll call you back.",8
S08E11,joey,Who was that?,8
S08E11,rachel,It’s just the pizza place.,8
S08E11,joey,You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.,8
S08E11,rachel,"I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.",8
S08E11,joey,"Oh, what’s wrong?",8
S08E11,rachel,"Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.",8
S08E11,joey,Then why did I ask?,8
S08E11,rachel,"Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.",8
S08E11,joey,Is that college talk for horny?,8
S08E11,rachel,"Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find.  So how was your day?",8
S08E11,joey,"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.",8
S08E11,rachel,"Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.",8

S08E12,monica,"Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.",8.5
S08E12,chandler,"Oh, okay.",8.5
S08E12,monica,All right.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,I kinda like it here.,8.5
S08E12,phoebe,Do you really like it?,8.5
S08E12,monica,"Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!",8.5
S08E12,phoebe,Oh really? What was your first?,8.5
S08E12,monica,Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,Well what did it do?,8.5
S08E12,monica,"Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.",8.5
S08E12,chandler,A vending machine?,8.5
S08E12,monica,Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!,8.5
S08E12,ross,"Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.",8.5
S08E12,joey,Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?,8.5
S08E12,ross,"Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….",8.5
S08E12,rachel,They made you head of the department!,8.5
S08E12,ross,"No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Yeah.,8.5
S08E12,joey,"I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Uh, Paul’s Caf�. They got great food and it’s really romantic.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Ooh, great! Thanks!",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!",8.5
S08E12,joey,"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Hey, y’know what?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Huh?,8.5
S08E12,joey,Why don’t I take you out?,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…",8.5

S08E12,monica,"Okay, I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!",8.5
S08E12,phoebe,"Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.",8.5
S08E12,monica,Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!,8.5
S08E12,chandler,Who cares? It’s a stupid game.,8.5
S08E12,monica,You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.,8.5
S08E12,phoebe,"Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.",8.5
S08E12,monica,"No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?",8.5
S08E12,chandler,Why do you want to play this game so bad?,8.5
S08E12,phoebe,Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.,8.5
S08E12,monica,"Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get out!  Oh come…Phoebe!",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"And, a brownie!  Well, half a brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.",8.5
S08E12,joey,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Hm-mmm.,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",8.5
S08E12,ross,"…which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.  Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?",8.5
S08E12,ross,"What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.",8.5
S08E12,ross,Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!,8.5
S08E12,ross,"Hello.  So to sum up, I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for— I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Oh my God. And that works?!,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Well it does when you combine it with, \This is so embarrassing",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Oh, you poor little famous man.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Alright. So where’d you grow up?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Come on, just answer the question!",8.5
S08E12,joey,Queens.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,And so were-were you close to your parents?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Why not?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,It’s gotta be rough.,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Huh?,8.5
S08E12,joey,\Where’d you grow up,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.",8.5
S08E12,joey,Yeah.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,And now you’re watching me walk away.,8.5
S08E12,joey,Yes I am! Again so simple!,8.5
S08E12,monica,Hey.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,You are not going to believe what I did today!,8.5
S08E12,monica,Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.,8.5
S08E12,monica,"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",8.5
S08E12,chandler,"Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!",8.5
S08E12,monica,What is the matter with your hand?,8.5
S08E12,chandler,"Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.",8.5
S08E12,monica,"Chandler, why would you do that?",8.5
S08E12,chandler,Because it’s awesome.,8.5
S08E12,monica,You think this is clever?,8.5
S08E12,chandler,"Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.",8.5
S08E12,monica,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.",8.5
S08E12,chandler,It is when you put it together with that one.,8.5
S08E12,monica,"Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.",8.5
S08E12,chandler,"Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.",8.5
S08E12,monica,Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,Have you talked to him lately?,8.5
S08E12,monica,"All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.",8.5
S08E12,chandler,"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  Chip in it or something!",8.5
S08E12,monica,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,8.5
S08E12,chandler,With the claw?!,8.5
S08E12,monica,"All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",8.5
S08E12,chandler,—My hand is messed up.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,I am not gonna answer that!,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.",8.5
S08E12,joey,Chandler?,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",8.5
S08E12,rachel,I know!,8.5
S08E12,joey,I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,8.5
S08E12,joey,Huh. Huh.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,How do you do that?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Oh my God!,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"No, I don’t want to tell you.",8.5
S08E12,joey,Why not?,8.5
S08E12,rachel,Because it’s embarrassing.,8.5
S08E12,joey,"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, \Hmmm.\"" Okay",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",8.5
S08E12,joey,Oh.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",8.5
S08E12,ross,"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, \Get the hell out of my way!\""",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?",8.5
S08E12,ross,"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.,8.5
S08E12,ross,"Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,You what?,8.5
S08E12,ross,"You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Right. Wow!,8.5
S08E12,ross,"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars.",8.5
S08E12,joey,Hey!,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!,8.5
S08E12,joey,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Well don’t you have that big date tonight?,8.5
S08E12,joey,Oh right!,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?",8.5
S08E12,joey,Yeah.,8.5
S08E12,rachel,"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!",8.5
S08E12,rachel,I don’t know!  I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah me too, all night.",8.5
S08E12,rachel,Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.",8.5
S08E12,monica,"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right— Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?",8.5
S08E12,phoebe,—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!,8.5
S08E12,monica,They’re all Chandler.,8.5
S08E12,phoebe,Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!,8.5
S08E12,chandler,I did.  But it came at a price.,8.5
S08E12,monica,But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.,8.5
S08E12,chandler,"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!",8.5
S08E12,ross,"Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time!",8.5
S08E12,joey,"No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.",8.5
S08E12,joey,"Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking about.",8.5

S08E12,joey,Alone?!,8.5
S08E12,rachel,Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!,8.5
S08E12,joey,"Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?",8.5
S08E12,rachel,"No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?",8.5

S08E12,joey,"Oh uh, okay. Yeah.",8.5

S08E12,joey,Terrified.,8.5
S08E12,ross,"So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.  Now as for the hydrosaurs…",8.5
S08E13,joey,"All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.",8.6

S08E13,monica,"Wait, you like them with me.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Oh, baths are so relaxing!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?",8.6
S08E13,joey,"Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?",8.6
S08E13,joey,"Well, neither.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Oh my God, what’s up?!",8.6
S08E13,joey,"I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is…",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.",8.6
S08E13,joey,"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Do you?,8.6
S08E13,joey,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",8.6
S08E13,chandler,In London?,8.6
S08E13,joey,Yeah.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",8.6
S08E13,joey,"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,If that.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!",8.6
S08E13,ross,Right.,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?",8.6
S08E13,ross,"No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!,8.6
S08E13,ross,And smart!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Popular.,8.6
S08E13,ross,With an aptitude for science.,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!,8.6
S08E13,ross,Really? Me too!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Me too!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Really?!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!",8.6
S08E13,ross,"Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.",8.6
S08E13,ross,Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Okay fine, what do you have?",8.6
S08E13,ross,"Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Yeah, by Sandrine.",8.6
S08E13,ross,You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"I’m really, really not.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,How-how about you each get five vetoes?,8.6
S08E13,ross,All right.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,All right.,8.6
S08E13,ross,That sounds fair.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.",8.6
S08E13,ross,Veto.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Why?,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Ross, why do you hate our child?",8.6
S08E13,ross,"Fine, you go.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Okay, James.",8.6
S08E13,ross,Huh.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,But only if it’s a girl.,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?",8.6
S08E13,rachel,Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?,8.6
S08E13,ross,Veto. Stewart?,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Veto. Sawyer?,8.6
S08E13,ross,Veto. Helen?,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Veto.,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Hey.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Sex on the balcony?,8.6
S08E13,monica,"No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?",8.6
S08E13,chandler,What is it?,8.6
S08E13,monica,I drew you a bath!,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Well, this does butch it up a bit.",8.6
S08E13,monica,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?",8.6
S08E13,monica,Absolutely.,8.6
S08E13,monica,Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.",8.6
S08E13,monica,So?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,Oh my God.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,I’m going to need a bigger boat.,8.6
S08E13,ross,"I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",8.6
S08E13,ross,"Uh, no. No, we’re not.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,8.6
S08E13,ross,"No, no, we want to wait, right?",8.6
S08E13,rachel,Right. Right.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?",8.6
S08E13,ross,"What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,Third one from the left?,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.  Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!",8.6
S08E13,rachel,What?!,8.6
S08E13,ross,You’re looking!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,I didn’t!,8.6
S08E13,ross,I saw you!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.",8.6
S08E13,ross,Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Okay, but Ross just listen to me…",8.6
S08E13,ross,"No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",8.6
S08E13,ross,Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",8.6
S08E13,monica,Hello?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.",8.6
S08E13,monica,You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,I’m in the bathtub.,8.6
S08E13,monica,Oh.  What’s wrong?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!",8.6
S08E13,monica,What?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.  It’s interesting.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Okay, let’s talk about something else.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…",8.6
S08E13,chandler,I had the exact same conversation.,8.6
S08E13,monica,You did? What was he talking about?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!,8.6
S08E13,monica,That was a long night.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Okay, he was talking about rules.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Uh-huh.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Umm, and looking at people differently.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,He didn’t say anything about that to me.,8.6
S08E13,monica,What did he tell you?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,But what did he mean by rules?,8.6
S08E13,monica,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,8.6
S08E13,chandler,Because he was looking at her differently.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,You guys?,8.6
S08E13,monica,Just a minute!  That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!,8.6
S08E13,chandler,You don’t say anything.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",8.6
S08E13,chandler,I’m not going to let you say anything.,8.6
S08E13,monica,You just stay here!,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Oh, God!",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Oh, you had that?",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,What?,8.6
S08E13,monica,Nothing.,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Okay.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Fine.,8.6
S08E13,monica,It’s a humdinger!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.,8.6
S08E13,monica,Somebody likes you!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Is it Chandler?,8.6
S08E13,monica,No!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Well, then tell him to stop staring!",8.6
S08E13,monica,It’s Joey!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.,8.6
S08E13,monica,Is it something you’d be interested in?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.",8.6
S08E13,monica,"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Not Chandler, just Joey.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Sure.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Hey.,8.6
S08E13,ross,Hey.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!",8.6
S08E13,rachel,I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,8.6
S08E13,ross,"I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,I would—Sequoia?,8.6
S08E13,ross,Veto.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,Fine.,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",8.6
S08E13,ross,Not like this!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Hey.,8.6
S08E13,joey,"Hey. Well, what’s up?",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Umm, Joey, I know.",8.6
S08E13,joey,What?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,I knooow.,8.6
S08E13,joey,Whaaat?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,I know about your feelings.,8.6
S08E13,joey,Oh my God. You do?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.",8.6
S08E13,joey,"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"For God sakes, it’s Rachel!",8.6
S08E13,joey,I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Yeah that’s Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.,8.6
S08E13,joey,"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Yeah.,8.6
S08E13,joey,"She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",8.6
S08E13,joey,You think?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",8.6
S08E13,joey,"Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.",8.6
S08E13,joey,Not really.,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Mm-hmm.  Throw me a bone here.,8.6
S08E13,ross,"So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.",8.6
S08E13,rachel,What?,8.6
S08E13,ross,That’s right. The student has become the master.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Ross, I swear, I don’t know.",8.6
S08E13,ross,"Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!",8.6
S08E13,rachel,A what?!,8.6
S08E13,ross,You really didn’t know?,8.6
S08E13,rachel,We’re having a girl?,8.6
S08E13,ross,No.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,That’s what you just said!,8.6
S08E13,ross,No.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,You said girl!,8.6
S08E13,ross,Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!,8.6
S08E13,ross,I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…",8.6
S08E13,ross,Permission to veto.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Yes, please.",8.6
S08E13,monica,Hey.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,Do I smell essential oils?,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Okay.,8.6
S08E13,monica,What do you think you’re doing?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,L-leaving my troubles behind?,8.6
S08E13,monica,"I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Hey!,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",8.6
S08E13,chandler,You told her?!,8.6
S08E13,monica,She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!",8.6
S08E13,monica,What?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?",8.6
S08E13,monica,I don’t think I’d care.,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Really? Lee Majors is hot!,8.6
S08E13,joey,Hello?,8.6
S08E13,phoebe,We’re in the bathroom!,8.6
S08E13,joey,Why?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!,8.6
S08E13,joey,What are you guys doing in here?,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!",8.6
S08E13,chandler,You like Rachel?!,8.6
S08E13,joey,"It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away!  Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Mazel tov.,8.6
S08E13,rachel,NA,8.6
S08E13,monica,"Honey, cover it up with the boat!",8.6
S08E13,ross,Hello?,8.6
S08E13,chandler,Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!,8.6
S08E13,ross,"Hey, did you, did you tell them?",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"No, I was waiting for you!",8.6
S08E13,phoebe,Tell us what?,8.6
S08E13,rachel,We’re having a girl.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,I’ll…I’ll get you later!,8.6
S08E13,joey,"All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, \it was cuckoo!\"" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.""",8.6
S08E13,rachel,"Hi, sweetie.",8.6
S08E13,joey,I love you.,8.6
S08E13,monica,"It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?",8.6
S08E13,chandler,Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.,8.6
S08E13,monica,I’m not touching you.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,You’re not?,8.6
S08E13,monica,It’s the salts.,8.6
S08E13,chandler,"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!",8.6
S08E13,monica,"Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!",8.6
S08E14,monica,"Hey, what’s up?",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Well, I left my guitar here again.",8.2
S08E14,monica,"Oh, okay. No problem.",8.2

S08E14,monica,NA,8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Hey Pheebs, what’s up?",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!,8.2
S08E14,monica,"Phoebe, I can explain!",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,You told me you hate massages!,8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?,8.2

S08E14,monica,"Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?",8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?",8.2
S08E14,monica,No reason. I-I keep private things in there.,8.2

S08E14,phoebe,Why won’t you let me massage you?,8.2
S08E14,monica,Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!,8.2
S08E14,monica,"That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,I’m curious about the human body.,8.2
S08E14,monica,"Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?",8.2
S08E14,monica,"Okay, if it means that much to you…",8.2

S08E14,joey,A dreamless sleep.,8.2

S08E14,joey,Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.,8.2
S08E14,ross,"Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.",8.2

S08E14,joey,"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",8.2
S08E14,chandler,Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.,8.2
S08E14,joey,Why not?,8.2
S08E14,chandler,I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!,8.2
S08E14,joey,"I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.",8.2
S08E14,chandler,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!",8.2
S08E14,chandler,And here we go…,8.2
S08E14,joey,"I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!",8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!!",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.",8.2

S08E14,joey,Hey! So?,8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?",8.2
S08E14,joey,So but everything is normal.,8.2
S08E14,joey,And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?,8.2
S08E14,rachel,Thank you doctor.  Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.,8.2
S08E14,joey,Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!,8.2
S08E14,rachel,But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.,8.2
S08E14,joey,Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!,8.2
S08E14,rachel,But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!,8.2
S08E14,joey,You sure?!,8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?",8.2
S08E14,joey,Oh hey-hey!,8.2
S08E14,ross,Is everything okay?,8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Yeah, everything’s fine!",8.2
S08E14,ross,"Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?",8.2
S08E14,joey,Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.,8.2
S08E14,ross,"Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.",8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Okay, no uterus, no opinion.",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Hey uh, what’s with the candy?",8.2
S08E14,ross,Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.,8.2
S08E14,rachel,Oh you went to the movies by yourself?,8.2
S08E14,ross,No I—Mona!,8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Oh, I gotta go back in there.",8.2
S08E14,ross,What? Why? What’s wrong?,8.2
S08E14,rachel,"No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…",8.2
S08E14,ross,"No really, you tell me what’s up.",8.2
S08E14,rachel,I-I forgot my underwear.,8.2
S08E14,ross,"So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.",8.2
S08E14,ross,"Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers!",8.2
S08E14,chandler,There has got to be a way!,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?",8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Yeah.  Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.",8.2
S08E14,joey,Then why do you throw like one?,8.2
S08E14,chandler,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Sure. \Monica.\""",8.2
S08E14,chandler,"So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",8.2
S08E14,chandler,That’s a good idea.,8.2
S08E14,joey,Yeah.,8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Oh, I just…I feel terrible.",8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong.  Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?",8.2
S08E14,monica,Hey.,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,Hey.,8.2
S08E14,monica,"I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"No-no, I got that.",8.2
S08E14,monica,"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.",8.2
S08E14,monica,Okay.,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,I mean $500.,8.2
S08E14,monica,What?,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,600,8.2
S08E14,monica,What’s going on?,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!",8.2
S08E14,monica,What?,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",8.2
S08E14,monica,What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,Really? There’s nothing sexual about this?  I mean hi.,8.2
S08E14,monica,"Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!",8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",8.2
S08E14,monica,Really?!,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",8.2
S08E14,monica,Are you sure?,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,Yes.,8.2
S08E14,monica,I guess.,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?",8.2
S08E14,rachel,Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!,8.2
S08E14,ross,"Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.",8.2

S08E14,ross,Well yeah!,8.2
S08E14,rachel,Oh Ross!!,8.2
S08E14,ross,What?! What?! Rach what?!,8.2
S08E14,joey,What’s going on?,8.2
S08E14,ross,"I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.",8.2
S08E14,joey,Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.,8.2
S08E14,ross,"I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?",8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",8.2
S08E14,joey,I’m on it!,8.2
S08E14,ross,I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!,8.2
S08E14,joey,Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,8.2
S08E14,ross,"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.",8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",8.2
S08E14,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S08E14,rachel,What’s up?,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.",8.2
S08E14,rachel,Are you breaking up with us?,8.2
S08E14,joey,"The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff, okay?  And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…",8.2
S08E14,rachel,Yeah?,8.2
S08E14,joey,Maybe you two should live together.,8.2
S08E14,rachel,Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.",8.2
S08E14,rachel,"But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean——Or he does.",8.2
S08E14,ross,No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.,8.2
S08E14,rachel,"But Ross, its you and me!",8.2
S08E14,ross,So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!,8.2
S08E14,joey,"All right now, so? What do you think?",8.2
S08E14,rachel,I don’t know. Is it crazy?,8.2
S08E14,ross,"No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.",8.2
S08E14,joey,"Well, I was due.",8.2
S08E14,rachel,"Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.",8.2
S08E14,ross,Really?,8.2
S08E14,rachel,Yeah.,8.2
S08E14,ross,Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great.,8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools.  Oh my God!",8.2
S08E14,monica,How did you get in there?!,8.2
S08E14,chandler,You’re messy.,8.2
S08E14,monica,Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!,8.2
S08E14,chandler,I married Fred Sanford!,8.2
S08E14,monica,"No Chandler, you don’t understand!  Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.",8.2
S08E14,chandler,"No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.",8.2
S08E14,monica,Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?,8.2
S08E14,chandler,"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.",8.2
S08E14,monica,Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.,8.2
S08E14,chandler,Hey.,8.2
S08E14,joey,Hey.,8.2
S08E14,chandler,So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.",8.2
S08E14,chandler,Are you okay?,8.2
S08E14,joey,"Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!",8.2
S08E14,monica,Ohhh.,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,That’s it. Just relax.,8.2
S08E14,monica,Ohh. Oh! Ohh!,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,Come on more!,8.2
S08E14,monica,Oh God!,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Yeah, you like that don’t you?",8.2
S08E14,monica,Oh yeah right there!,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,You want it there? You take it there baby!,8.2
S08E14,monica,Uh Phoebe?,8.2
S08E14,phoebe,"Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again.",8.2
S08E15,phoebe,"Oh! Hey, Rach!",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Oh, you, too.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages?  Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,Okay.,8.4
S08E15,joey,Bye.,8.4
S08E15,joey,There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?",8.4
S08E15,joey,Thanks. But maybe later.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?",8.4
S08E15,joey,You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Oh, okay.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Uh, I’m going to take off.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!",8.4
S08E15,ross,What is it?,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?,8.4
S08E15,ross,All right.  ‘Candy and Cookie?’,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Oh, Monica, grow up!",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Hey, what’s behind your back?",8.4
S08E15,monica,Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.,8.4
S08E15,ross,You don’t want my opinion?,8.4
S08E15,monica,Not really.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!",8.4
S08E15,monica,"All right, big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?",8.4
S08E15,ross,The red one.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,He-hee!,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Thanks so much, Pheebs!  Oh! Not that kind of fun.",8.4
S08E15,chandler,Happy Valentine’s!,8.4
S08E15,monica,"Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.",8.4
S08E15,chandler,NA,8.4
S08E15,chandler,"I love you, St. Valentine.",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!",8.4
S08E15,chandler,Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!,8.4
S08E15,chandler,I am trying!,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball!  Well, you’re cute, but you’re not too smart!",8.4
S08E15,joey,Did I just throw this?,8.4
S08E15,rachel,Hi.,8.4
S08E15,joey,Hi.,8.4
S08E15,rachel,I accidentally packed these with my stuff.  Who is this?,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,NA,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Well, you used to be.",8.4
S08E15,monica,NA,8.4
S08E15,monica,I’ve still got it!,8.4
S08E15,chandler,Why did you get me this?,8.4
S08E15,monica,What is it?,8.4
S08E15,chandler,"It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?",8.4
S08E15,chandler,I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.,8.4
S08E15,monica,"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day…  Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Honey, what’s going on?",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?",8.4
S08E15,monica,Mm-hmm.,8.4
S08E15,chandler,How long it took to go back in the water?,8.4
S08E15,monica,"Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!",8.4
S08E15,chandler,You don’t know. You didn’t see it.,8.4
S08E15,monica,"Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"See, honey, there’s—",8.4
S08E15,monica,Don’t touch me!,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?",8.4
S08E15,ross,Yeah?,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.",8.4
S08E15,ross,I do too! I missed you!,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!",8.4
S08E15,ross,Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.",8.4
S08E15,ross,What?,8.4
S08E15,ross,Huh…uh-huh.,8.4
S08E15,ross,NA,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?,8.4
S08E15,ross,"I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.",8.4
S08E15,ross,Ever?!,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,Hey!,8.4
S08E15,joey,Hey.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?  Did you give him a beer?",8.4
S08E15,joey,No.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!",8.4
S08E15,phoebe,He’s miserable! What happened to him?,8.4
S08E15,joey,Nothing. We just talked about stuff.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,What stuff?,8.4
S08E15,joey,Rachel stuff.,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",8.4
S08E15,joey,He’s breathing!,8.4
S08E15,phoebe,"Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look!  Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!",8.4
S08E15,ross,Ayyyayyyy!,8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Oh, hey, Mona!",8.4
S08E15,ross,I have no idea!,8.4
S08E15,rachel,I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.",8.4
S08E15,ross,I think she’s lonely.,8.4
S08E15,ross,I know.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!",8.4
S08E15,ross,"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.",8.4
S08E15,ross,NA,8.4
S08E15,rachel,I’m just going to grab the phone.,8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"But, but, Mona, I live here.",8.4
S08E15,ross,Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.,8.4
S08E15,monica,How long has it been this time?,8.4
S08E15,chandler,90 seconds.,8.4
S08E15,monica,That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.,8.4
S08E15,chandler,"You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",8.4
S08E15,chandler,I can do that.,8.4
S08E15,monica,Okay.,8.4
S08E15,chandler,Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.,8.4
S08E15,monica,"Oh, thank God!",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Oh, I know!",8.4
S08E15,monica,Come in!,8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Oh, my God.",8.4
S08E15,chandler,Poor Ross.,8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",8.4
S08E15,monica,"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!",8.4
S08E15,monica,"She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Okay, here we go.",8.4
S08E15,rachel,Okay.  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!,8.4
S08E15,chandler,Why have I seen this thing three times?!,8.4
S08E15,monica,It’s…still beautiful.,8.4
S08E15,rachel,Uh! It’s horrible!,8.4
S08E15,monica,"I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!",8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Oh, my God!",8.4
S08E15,chandler,"Wait, you guys, look!",8.4
S08E15,rachel,What? Did her ass explode?!,8.4
S08E15,chandler,"No, the baby’s out! Look, look!",8.4
S08E15,monica,"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",8.4
S08E15,chandler,And look how happy the mom is now!,8.4
S08E15,monica,Oh…Rach!,8.4
S08E15,rachel,"Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Hey, hey, man!",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Hey, what’s up?",8.4
S08E15,ross,Uh…Mona just dumped me.,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?",8.4
S08E15,joey,Sort of.,8.4
S08E15,ross,Really?!,8.4
S08E15,joey,You don’t have to seem so happy about it.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Oh, I…I d—",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during sex.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",8.4
S08E15,joey,Forget about it. It’s no big deal.,8.4
S08E15,ross,C’mon! Joey! What is it?,8.4
S08E15,joey,It’s nothing.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Okay, uh…sit down.  Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.",8.4
S08E15,ross,She’s not a Tribbiani?,8.4
S08E15,joey,No!,8.4
S08E15,ross,"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",8.4
S08E15,joey,Yes.,8.4
S08E15,ross,"Well, uh, does she like you?",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.",8.4
S08E15,ross,Why not?,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?",8.4
S08E15,joey,No. I don’t think so.,8.4
S08E15,ross,Okay. Um… is he a good guy?,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Yeah, he’s the best.",8.4
S08E15,ross,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,8.4
S08E15,joey,"Oh, I don’t know.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.",8.4
S08E15,joey,"Oh, yeah.",8.4
S08E15,ross,"Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.",8.4
S08E15,joey,It’s Rachel.,8.4
S08E15,rachel,NA,8.4
S08E15,rachel,Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.,8.4
S08E16,joey,"There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Yeah, he’s the best.",8.3
S08E16,ross,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Oh, I don’t know.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",8.3
S08E16,joey,"I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",8.3
S08E16,joey,It’s Rachel.,8.3
S08E16,ross,"Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?",8.3
S08E16,joey,Yes.,8.3
S08E16,ross,"Um, you…you like Rachel?",8.3
S08E16,joey,Yes. I like Rachel.,8.3
S08E16,ross,Rachel?!,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.",8.3
S08E16,ross,But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?",8.3
S08E16,joey,"I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",8.3
S08E16,ross,Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.",8.3
S08E16,ross,Y’know what? I-I gotta go.,8.3
S08E16,joey,Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…,8.3
S08E16,ross,I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!",8.3
S08E16,chandler,Oh!  She’s growing inside you.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Whoa!!,8.3
S08E16,chandler,Oh!,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Wow that was a big one.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Oh hey you guys!,8.3
S08E16,chandler,Oh hey!,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Hi!,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Uh-huh,  and you?",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Okay, good.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,Why?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Well last night, I met Monica’s.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,What?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Come on, don’t be crazy.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Well, what’s he like?!",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Well he’s tall.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Uh-huh.,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,He has brown hair.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Of course, of course.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,He works with food!,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Oh sure. Older?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Obviously, and he’s British.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Oh, I was just gonna ask!",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",8.3
S08E16,monica,Hey.,8.3
S08E16,ross,Hey.,8.3
S08E16,monica,"I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!",8.3
S08E16,monica,"All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.",8.3
S08E16,monica,"Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.",8.3
S08E16,monica,Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!,8.3
S08E16,ross,He’s not?,8.3
S08E16,monica,"No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.",8.3
S08E16,ross,Why?,8.3
S08E16,monica,He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.,8.3
S08E16,ross,"Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?",8.3
S08E16,monica,"Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.",8.3
S08E16,monica,"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Oh! Hi!,8.3
S08E16,monica,Hi!,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Soul mate.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,What?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Soul mate.,8.3
S08E16,monica,"So, what have you guys been doing?",8.3
S08E16,monica,"I know! What is this, 1985?!",8.3
S08E16,monica,Not really.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  No?,8.3
S08E16,monica,"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?",8.3
S08E16,monica,"Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.",8.3
S08E16,monica,No!,8.3
S08E16,monica,"Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,What are you doing?!,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…,8.3
S08E16,chandler,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",8.3
S08E16,monica,"Phoebe, good work.",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,Yeah?,8.3
S08E16,monica,"Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him.",8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.",8.3
S08E16,joey,Hey.,8.3
S08E16,ross,Hey.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"No, I don’t want to hit you.",8.3
S08E16,joey,Oh what then? Kick me?,8.3
S08E16,ross,No.,8.3
S08E16,joey,Bite me?,8.3
S08E16,ross,"No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.",8.3
S08E16,joey,Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?,8.3
S08E16,ross,Uh…yeah sure.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…",8.3
S08E16,ross,Okay.,8.3
S08E16,joey,NA,8.3
S08E16,ross,Thank you.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…",8.3
S08E16,ross,What?! You’re in love with her.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Yeah, I thought you knew that.",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Umm, no.",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, \Ah",8.3
S08E16,ross,I think you need to tell her how you feel.,8.3
S08E16,joey,Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.,8.3
S08E16,ross,"No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",8.3
S08E16,joey,But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…,8.3
S08E16,ross,If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.,8.3
S08E16,joey,Are you sure?,8.3
S08E16,ross,"Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…",8.3
S08E16,joey,Hey thanks.,8.3
S08E16,ross,So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?,8.3
S08E16,joey,Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?,8.3
S08E16,ross,"I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.",8.3
S08E16,joey,"I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!",8.3
S08E16,ross,"Yeah, tell me about it.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",8.3
S08E16,monica,"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",8.3
S08E16,monica,"You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries…  And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.",8.3
S08E16,chandler,Is it made of cheese?,8.3
S08E16,monica,I’d move in tomorrow!,8.3
S08E16,chandler,Are you listening to this?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,I’m so sorry.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,What do we do?,8.3
S08E16,phoebe,"I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Joey? What’s up?,8.3
S08E16,joey,"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Okay what’s up?,8.3
S08E16,joey,Here? In the hall? What are we animals?,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah.  Don’t you people ever knock?!",8.3
S08E16,monica,I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?,8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.",8.3
S08E16,monica,Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",8.3
S08E16,monica,Jeez! What is with you?,8.3
S08E16,chandler,"I’m sorry, did you say cheese?",8.3
S08E16,monica,"All right, what’s going on?",8.3
S08E16,chandler,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",8.3
S08E16,monica,"Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?",8.3
S08E16,chandler,No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.,8.3
S08E16,monica,I don’t believe in soul mates either.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,You don’t?,8.3
S08E16,monica,No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?,8.3
S08E16,monica,"No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",8.3
S08E16,chandler,I love you.,8.3
S08E16,monica,I know.,8.3
S08E16,chandler,Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,…and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  Are you okay?,8.3
S08E16,joey,"What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…—Is it hot in here?",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?",8.3
S08E16,joey,"I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?,8.3
S08E16,joey,Yeah. Sure.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.",8.3
S08E16,joey,Uh… How long have we known each other?,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Uh-huh, long time.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Yeah.,8.3
S08E16,joey,But over the past few weeks…,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Actually uh, could you give us a second?",8.3
S08E16,rachel,So you were saying?,8.3
S08E16,joey,I’m not quite sure.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, \Eight years.\"" And the um",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,What?,8.3
S08E16,joey,I’m falling in love with you.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?",8.3
S08E16,joey,Does it really matter?,8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you gotta say something!",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…",8.3
S08E16,joey,But.,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Joey.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!",8.3
S08E16,joey,"Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,Can I?,8.3
S08E16,joey,Sure!,8.3
S08E16,rachel,Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!",8.3
S08E16,rachel,I’m so sorry.,8.3
S08E16,joey,"Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.  Y’know I was only kidding you.",8.3
S08E16,rachel,"Yeah, that was a real good one.",8.3
S08E17,rachel,Joey? Are you in there?,8.1
S08E17,joey,Oh God! That’s Rachel!,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Joey, you have to talk to her!",8.1
S08E17,joey,"No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Hey!,8.1
S08E17,chandler,Hey!,8.1
S08E17,monica,Hey Rachel!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Is Joey here?,8.1
S08E17,chandler,I don’t see him.  Do you see him?,8.1
S08E17,monica,I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Well, at least you make each other laugh.",8.1
S08E17,monica,What’s up?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?",8.1
S08E17,monica,We were playing a game.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?",8.1
S08E17,monica,Sure.,8.1
S08E17,chandler,What?! No! No!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him.",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Okay, did you hear that?",8.1
S08E17,joey,"Yeah, a naked bagel game?  Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Honey, you gotta talk to her.",8.1
S08E17,joey,I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,8.1
S08E17,chandler,"I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \I love you",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.",8.1
S08E17,joey,"All right so, so what do I do?",8.1
S08E17,monica,"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.",8.1
S08E17,joey,Yeah. Okay.  I almost forgot this was on your…,8.1
S08E17,chandler,We didn’t play it!!,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.",8.1
S08E17,chandler,I didn’t know you read tea leaves.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Okay, I’m done. Read mine.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Okay.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.,8.1
S08E17,monica,I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?",8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Okay, I’m done. Do mine.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Okay.  Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Ah.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Oh!  Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",8.1
S08E17,chandler,What does yours say Pheebs?,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Umm… Wow, all right.",8.1
S08E17,ross,"Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?",8.1
S08E17,monica,You mean your pink shirt?,8.1
S08E17,ross,Faded salmon color.,8.1
S08E17,monica,"No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.",8.1
S08E17,ross,Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!,8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.",8.1
S08E17,ross,That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Well just ask Mona to give it back!,8.1
S08E17,ross,"I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,NA,8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Hi!,8.1
S08E17,joey,Hey.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Hi.,8.1
S08E17,joey,Hi.,8.1
S08E17,monica,Tea gives Phoebe the trots.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.",8.1
S08E17,chandler,"I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!",8.1
S08E17,chandler,"I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",8.1
S08E17,chandler,Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?",8.1
S08E17,chandler,In the James Taylor case.,8.1
S08E17,monica,Where is the James Taylor CD?,8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.",8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Oh yeah. That makes sense.,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Ooh, I can do that.",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?",8.1
S08E17,chandler,They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.,8.1
S08E17,joey,Hey!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Hi.,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,What?,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow!",8.1
S08E17,joey,"So you uh, have a…big work problem?",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.,8.1
S08E17,joey,"Huh. Okay.  So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.,8.1
S08E17,joey,Yeah?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Yeah, and umm my baby.",8.1
S08E17,joey,Yeah?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,My boss wants to buy my baby!,8.1
S08E17,joey,What?! Oh my-oh my God!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.",8.1
S08E17,joey,What he wants to buy your baby?!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Can you believe that?!,8.1
S08E17,joey,That’s crazy!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,That’s what I told him!,8.1
S08E17,joey,"Okay, how did this even happen?",8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Well I’ll tell ya!  See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, \Rachel",8.1
S08E17,joey,Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Ohh! Yeah!  Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Oh hello.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Well, maybe we will.",8.1
S08E17,ross,Mona?,8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.",8.1
S08E17,monica,"Honey, both yours.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!,8.1
S08E17,monica,Yeah? The work problem?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.,8.1
S08E17,chandler,What problem did you tell him you had?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.",8.1
S08E17,joey,Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Oh, witty banter. Well done.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"I-I-I like, I like parties.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Yeah I guess, a little.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Oh stop it.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Okay.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,What?!,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Oh my God!,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Wow! You do?,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,All right.,8.1
S08E17,chandler,…there’ll be sun.,8.1
S08E17,joey,Hey!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.",8.1
S08E17,joey,"Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,What?,8.1
S08E17,joey,Let’s just say I took care of it.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!",8.1
S08E17,joey,"Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, \You don’t go buying people’s babies",8.1
S08E17,rachel,What?!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!",8.1
S08E17,joey,What?! Why?!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!,8.1
S08E17,joey,And you couldn’t think of anything else?!,8.1
S08E17,monica,You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!,8.1
S08E17,chandler,You can always sell your baby.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!",8.1
S08E17,joey,You lied to me!,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Well, she told me too!",8.1
S08E17,monica,Chandler has two copies of Annie!,8.1
S08E17,ross,Hello!!,8.1
S08E17,ross,Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Morning. You wanted to see me?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Okay look Mr. Zelner…,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Yeah.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Oh God.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Well, as long as we are clear about that.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Oh there it is.,8.1
S08E17,monica,That’s not your regular dry cleaners.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…",8.1
S08E17,monica,What?!,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?  When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",8.1
S08E17,monica,Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,Okay.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,What?,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,A little.  Now you’re talking.,8.1
S08E17,phoebe,I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.,8.1
S08E17,monica,"Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?",8.1
S08E17,phoebe,She must’ve left.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,Hi.,8.1
S08E17,joey,So? What-what-what happened?,8.1
S08E17,rachel,It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.,8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Chandler, can you give us a minute?",8.1
S08E17,chandler,"Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Yeah.,8.1
S08E17,chandler,I’ll be in there.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…",8.1
S08E17,joey,I know. I know.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,"It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.",8.1
S08E17,joey,"Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.",8.1
S08E17,rachel,Yeah I know! I miss that.,8.1
S08E17,joey,Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.,8.1
S08E17,rachel,My gynecologist tried to kill me.,8.1
S08E17,ross,NA,8.1
S08E17,ross,You do?,8.1
S08E17,ross,Oh God you’re right.,8.1
S08E17,ross,NA,8.1
S08E18,phoebe,"Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?",8.2
S08E18,monica,Yeah.,8.2
S08E18,ross,Sure. Yeah.,8.2
S08E18,joey,"So, who’s the guy?",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.",8.2
S08E18,chandler,"Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.",8.2
S08E18,monica,"Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?",8.2
S08E18,ross,"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?",8.2
S08E18,monica,"Yeah, I’d really like to.",8.2
S08E18,ross,"Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.",8.2
S08E18,monica,"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.",8.2
S08E18,chandler,And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?,8.2
S08E18,monica,"No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \God",8.2
S08E18,joey,"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.",8.2
S08E18,monica,Really you can do that?,8.2
S08E18,joey,Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!,8.2
S08E18,chandler,What are you doing?,8.2

S08E18,chandler,It’s a dog.,8.2

S08E18,chandler,It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?,8.2
S08E18,monica,"The good stuff, huh?",8.2

S08E18,ross,Aww that is so cool.,8.2
S08E18,joey,And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.,8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?",8.2

S08E18,ross,"Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.",8.2
S08E18,monica,What?!,8.2
S08E18,ross,You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Hey!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…",8.2

S08E18,rachel,"I, uh, think you already are.",8.2
S08E18,monica,That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.,8.2
S08E18,monica,It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.,8.2
S08E18,ross,"Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.",8.2
S08E18,monica,"Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents?",8.2
S08E18,chandler,Yeah.,8.2
S08E18,monica,And I’ve got the car keys.,8.2
S08E18,monica,Yeah.,8.2
S08E18,ross,"So uh, he seems like a nice guy.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.",8.2
S08E18,ross,Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?,8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Yeah, otherwise I’m not going.",8.2
S08E18,ross,Hi!  Hey mom.,8.2
S08E18,rachel,"This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?",8.2
S08E18,ross,"That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…",8.2
S08E18,rachel,Hmmm….,8.2
S08E18,rachel,Thank you…we’re so excited,8.2
S08E18,ross,Wha—What?,8.2
S08E18,ross,Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?,8.2
S08E18,ross,Can you believe that?,8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.",8.2
S08E18,ross,"No, us having to lie about being married.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.",8.2
S08E18,ross,"Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan",8.2
S08E18,rachel,Oh…,8.2
S08E18,rachel,Unbelievable!,8.2
S08E18,ross,We love marriage!,8.2
S08E18,ross,Hey,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Hey!,8.2
S08E18,chandler,I don’t think the flash went off.,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,I’ll go with you,8.2
S08E18,chandler,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.,8.2
S08E18,joey,"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.",8.2
S08E18,ross,I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?,8.2
S08E18,monica,He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.,8.2
S08E18,ross,NA,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Were you guys making fun of Parker?,8.2
S08E18,ross,"That depends, how much did you hear?",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?",8.2
S08E18,monica,"It’s just that, it’s so much.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap.",8.2
S08E18,monica,I feel terrible.,8.2
S08E18,joey,I know,8.2
S08E18,ross,What was wrong with Mona?,8.2
S08E18,rachel,Open it! Open it! Open it!,8.2
S08E18,ross,Yeah baby!,8.2
S08E18,ross,"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,8.2
S08E18,ross,Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm…. what are you doing?,8.2
S08E18,rachel,What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.,8.2
S08E18,ross,"Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Hm huh, yeah.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"No, that’s not necessary.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"No, actually I don’t eat…",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Okay, fine! Fine!  Mmm…hmmmmm….",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Why don’t you just try one?,8.2
S08E18,chandler,What are you doin’?,8.2
S08E18,monica,Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.,8.2
S08E18,chandler,"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,Oh yeah. That’s a great story.,8.2
S08E18,ross,"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…",8.2
S08E18,rachel,Shhh! I want to hear the rest!,8.2
S08E18,ross,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \Will you marry me?\""",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"And the ring, was the size of my fist !",8.2
S08E18,joey,"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Then you better do it now.,8.2
S08E18,joey,Why?,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Because I’m going to kill him,8.2
S08E18,joey,What-what?,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.",8.2
S08E18,joey,"I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?,8.2
S08E18,joey,"I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.,8.2
S08E18,joey,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,You think?,8.2
S08E18,joey,Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.",8.2
S08E18,joey,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,What’s that now?,8.2
S08E18,joey,Nothing…,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Oh look it’s Parker!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Oooh I love it!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,8.2
S08E18,monica,"Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.",8.2
S08E18,monica,"No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you.  You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!",8.2
S08E18,ross,"Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.",8.2
S08E18,ross,"No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Oh thank God.,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Oh my God! Oh my God!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Much less happy!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!,8.2
S08E18,phoebe,Uh huh.,8.2
S08E18,ross,"…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.",8.2
S08E18,ross,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?,8.2
S08E18,rachel,It was really fun being married to you tonight.,8.2
S08E18,ross,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",8.2
S08E18,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S08E18,rachel,"That proposal, at the planetarium…",8.2
S08E18,ross,"I know, I know it was stupid.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",8.2
S08E18,ross,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",8.2
S08E18,rachel,"Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.",8.2
S08E18,ross,"It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night",8.2
S08E18,rachel,Goodnight,8.2
S08E18,ross,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?,8.2
S08E18,rachel,I will think about it.,8.2
S08E18,ross,That’s all I’m askin’,8.2
S08E18,monica,"Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.",8.2
S08E18,ross,Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,8.2
S08E18,monica,"Oh, come on.",8.2
S08E18,ross,"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",8.2
S08E18,monica,"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",8.2
S08E19,rachel,Hi!,7.5
S08E19,ross,Hey!,7.5
S08E19,monica,Hey!,7.5
S08E19,rachel,"So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!",7.5
S08E19,monica,How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down!,7.5
S08E19,joey,Yeah you are baby.,7.5
S08E19,monica,"Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?",7.5
S08E19,rachel,So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?,7.5
S08E19,joey,"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",7.5
S08E19,ross,Why’d you say no?,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",7.5
S08E19,chandler,If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.,7.5
S08E19,rachel,"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?",7.5
S08E19,chandler,Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?,7.5
S08E19,rachel,"Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.",7.5
S08E19,ross,"Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.",7.5
S08E19,rachel,"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Seriously, proud of you.",7.5
S08E19,joey,Yeah.,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.",7.5
S08E19,monica,You think we’re being obvious?,7.5
S08E19,chandler,"No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",7.5
S08E19,joey,And I’ll have all the muffins.,7.5
S08E19,phoebe,Hey!,7.5
S08E19,ross,Shhh! We’re not talking.,7.5
S08E19,phoebe,Oh. Finally! Oh.,7.5
S08E19,joey,NA,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Now, I can have milk everyday.",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship,  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray.",7.5
S08E19,chandler,Nice work my friend.,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.",7.5
S08E19,phoebe,"I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?",7.5
S08E19,rachel,"Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.",7.5
S08E19,ross,"Uh, double latte, extra foam.",7.5
S08E19,chandler,And a bagel with only…,7.5
S08E19,phoebe,I was just being polite!,7.5
S08E19,joey,Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?,7.5
S08E19,rachel,That is the Coast Guard.,7.5
S08E19,joey,What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.,7.5

S08E19,ross,"Come on, it's fun!",7.5
S08E19,chandler,All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",7.5
S08E19,chandler,"Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.",7.5
S08E19,joey,I think you’re right.,7.5
S08E19,chandler,"All right, ready?",7.5
S08E19,joey,One.,7.5
S08E19,chandler,Two.,7.5
S08E19,joey,That’s kinda nice.,7.5
S08E19,chandler,"Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.",7.5
S08E19,joey,Yeah.,7.5
S08E19,chandler,You wanna see if we still have it?,7.5
S08E19,joey,Yeah.,7.5

S08E19,joey,Right.,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Matter of fact, I do.",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.",7.5
S08E19,joey,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",7.5
S08E19,ross,Are you serious?!,7.5
S08E19,joey,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,7.5
S08E19,ross,Wow! We are pretty good at this!,7.5
S08E19,joey,Yeah!,7.5
S08E19,ross,Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",7.5
S08E19,chandler,What’s wrong with you?,7.5
S08E19,joey,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",7.5
S08E19,chandler,This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!,7.5
S08E19,joey,"No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  Damn you 15s!",7.5
S08E19,rachel,"It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef saut�ed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",7.5
S08E19,ross,It tastes like feet!,7.5
S08E19,joey,I like it.,7.5
S08E19,ross,Are you kidding?,7.5
S08E19,joey,What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.,7.5

S08E20,monica,Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.",8.2
S08E20,monica,"Oh my God, your mother!",8.2
S08E20,rachel,What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,My God!,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…",8.2
S08E20,monica,Oh give it a rest!,8.2
S08E20,rachel,So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,No.  Neither is mine.,8.2

S08E20,rachel,"Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"I know. I know, what’s her number?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,I don’t know.,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Go! I have it in my book. Go!  Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.",8.2
S08E20,monica,"Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.",8.2
S08E20,monica,"Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.",8.2

S08E20,chandler,Bogota.,8.2
S08E20,joey,"It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.",8.2
S08E20,chandler,What does a Wicked Wango card do?,8.2
S08E20,joey,"I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.",8.2
S08E20,chandler,Higher or lower than what?,8.2
S08E20,joey,This is embarrassing.,8.2
S08E20,chandler,Can you believe how lame this is?,8.2
S08E20,ross,"I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?",8.2
S08E20,monica,You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!,8.2
S08E20,monica,Hi!,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,I’m so glad you could make it.,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.",8.2
S08E20,monica,She’s still mad.,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.",8.2
S08E20,monica,Okay. I can do that.  I gotta go powder my ass.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,What?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Wh-wh-what? What?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Yes. Yes I do.,8.2
S08E20,joey,"All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",8.2
S08E20,ross,"The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.",8.2
S08E20,joey,"Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.",8.2
S08E20,ross,"It’s okay, I’m ready.",8.2
S08E20,joey,"No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.",8.2
S08E20,chandler,"This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath…",8.2
S08E20,joey,"Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?",8.2
S08E20,chandler,Let me see that.,8.2
S08E20,joey,This one right here.,8.2
S08E20,chandler,Triscadecaphobia.,8.2
S08E20,ross,The fear of Triscuts!,8.2
S08E20,joey,"No! No, fear of the number 13.",8.2
S08E20,chandler,Fear of Triscuts?,8.2
S08E20,ross,"It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.",8.2
S08E20,joey,"All right Chandler, you’re up.",8.2
S08E20,ross,"Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?",8.2
S08E20,chandler,This game makes no sense!,8.2
S08E20,ross,Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.,8.2
S08E20,chandler,"Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.",8.2
S08E20,joey,"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",8.2
S08E20,chandler,Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.,8.2
S08E20,joey,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.,8.2
S08E20,chandler,"Either, it makes no difference.",8.2
S08E20,joey,"Choose, you jackass!",8.2
S08E20,chandler,I’ll take a card.,8.2
S08E20,joey,"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!",8.2
S08E20,ross,What?!,8.2
S08E20,chandler,This game is kinda fun.,8.2
S08E20,ross,You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…,8.2
S08E20,chandler,I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Why did you invite my mother?!,8.2
S08E20,monica,What?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,For how long?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.",8.2
S08E20,monica,I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,She can’t hear you.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!",8.2
S08E20,monica,"That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!",8.2
S08E20,rachel,Okay.,8.2
S08E20,monica,This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!",8.2
S08E20,rachel,Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,Wow!,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Okay, this is from your friend at work.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is!  Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table?  What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Oh come——Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me.",8.2
S08E20,joey,"In what John Houston film would you hear this line, \Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!\""",8.2

S08E20,rachel,"Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,8.2

S08E20,rachel,Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.,8.2
S08E20,ross,"What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.",8.2
S08E20,ross,Hi roomie!,8.2

S08E20,rachel,I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.,8.2
S08E20,ross,I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"No, not a thing.",8.2
S08E20,monica,It’s frightening.,8.2
S08E20,ross,"Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.",8.2
S08E20,ross,Yeah.,8.2
S08E20,ross,"That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.",8.2
S08E20,ross,"Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.",8.2
S08E20,ross,Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!,8.2
S08E20,ross,"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,I hope you’re going somewhere with this.,8.2
S08E20,ross,Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Really?,8.2
S08E20,ross,I’m telling you.,8.2
S08E20,rachel,Thank you.,8.2
S08E20,ross,Oh.,8.2
S08E20,monica,What do I do?,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.",8.2
S08E20,monica,Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.",8.2
S08E20,monica,Really?,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,Uh-huh!,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green!  It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!",8.2
S08E20,monica,That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…",8.2
S08E20,monica,"So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day!  I can’t feel my legs!",8.2
S08E20,phoebe,You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!,8.2
S08E20,monica,Yeah? I’m proud of me too.,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,You should be!,8.2
S08E20,monica,Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?,8.2
S08E20,phoebe,You got it!,8.2
S08E20,monica,"Okay.  Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!",8.2
S08E20,rachel,Okay! I’m ready.,8.2
S08E20,ross,You sure?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.",8.2
S08E20,ross,All right then.  How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Uh, put your elbow in it.",8.2
S08E20,ross,Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?,8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.",8.2
S08E20,ross,"That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,"Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!",8.2
S08E20,ross,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?",8.2
S08E20,rachel,A card! A card! I pick a card!,8.2
S08E20,ross,"Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother!",8.2
S08E21,ross,Hey you guys I got some bad news.,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, \Extra! Extra! Read all about it!\""",8.2
S08E21,ross,"No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.",8.2
S08E21,joey,"Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  \Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.\""",8.2
S08E21,monica,Hey!,8.2
S08E21,chandler,Hey.,8.2
S08E21,monica,Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!,8.2
S08E21,ross,Umm…,8.2

S08E21,ross,"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.",8.2
S08E21,monica,What about the rest of Manhattan?!,8.2
S08E21,ross,"Yeah, they all know.",8.2
S08E21,monica,"Oh my God, this is horrible!",8.2
S08E21,chandler,I’m so sorry.,8.2
S08E21,monica,I’m so humiliated!,8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, \There’s no such thing as bad press.\""",8.2
S08E21,monica,"You don’t think that umm,  \The chef’s Mahi Mahi was awful awful",8.2

S08E21,rachel,That is seven days!,8.2
S08E21,ross,"Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…",8.2
S08E21,rachel,"No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!",8.2
S08E21,ross,It’s funny you should mention diapers.,8.2
S08E21,rachel,I’m serious.,8.2
S08E21,ross,"Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?",8.2
S08E21,rachel,Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…,8.2

S08E21,rachel,"Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that, isn’t that weird?",8.2
S08E21,ross,Well uh…,8.2
S08E21,rachel,I’m just kidding! You can go pee!,8.2
S08E21,joey,"Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?",8.2
S08E21,monica,"We said at the movies, but…",8.2
S08E21,joey,"Okay, I’ll see you there.",8.2
S08E21,monica,Joey!  Now that you’re here…,8.2
S08E21,joey,"Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya.  What uh—How come you’re not going?",8.2
S08E21,chandler,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.,8.2
S08E21,joey,I thought you already have a job.,8.2
S08E21,chandler,"And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.",8.2
S08E21,joey,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,8.2
S08E21,chandler,That’s what I do now.,8.2

S08E21,ross,"Oh, okay.",8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.",8.2
S08E21,ross,"I chose those, I’m a paleontologist.",8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.",8.2
S08E21,ross,Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.,8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I’m bored.",8.2
S08E21,ross,That’s my gym.,8.2
S08E21,ross,I am like Indiana Jones.,8.2

S08E21,phoebe,Well did she know you two weren’t married?,8.2
S08E21,rachel,Yeah.,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!",8.2
S08E21,rachel,You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,Sounds like you’re a little jealous.,8.2
S08E21,rachel,No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?,8.2
S08E21,chandler,Fatty!,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?",8.2
S08E21,chandler,"Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.",8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Wait, I think I know someone who does that.",8.2
S08E21,chandler,"Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous.",8.2
S08E21,rachel,Oh yeah! You really—You look great.,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up.",8.2
S08E21,chandler,Why not?,8.2

S08E21,phoebe,Oh you don’t know.,8.2
S08E21,chandler,Are you serious?!,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, \Blah",8.2
S08E21,chandler,What is it that I do?,8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy.",8.2
S08E21,chandler,Did you like me when we first met?,8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.",8.2
S08E21,monica,"Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.",8.2
S08E21,monica,"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.",8.2
S08E21,joey,"Either eat it, or be in it.",8.2
S08E21,monica,"Spoon?  So, what do you think?",8.2
S08E21,joey,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.,8.2

S08E21,monica,Monica.,8.2
S08E21,monica,Okay.,8.2

S08E21,ross,"My son? Pretty serious.  What uh, what are you doing here?",8.2
S08E21,ross,"Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.",8.2
S08E21,ross,Oh.,8.2

S08E21,joey,Hi.,8.2
S08E21,joey,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",8.2
S08E21,joey,Cheese makes me thirsty.,8.2
S08E21,joey,All right.,8.2
S08E21,monica,"Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",8.2
S08E21,monica,"I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",8.2
S08E21,monica,That’s right.,8.2
S08E21,chandler,"…I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.",8.2
S08E21,phoebe,"Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.",8.2
S08E21,chandler,"What I do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.",8.2
S08E21,phoebe,I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,8.2

S08E21,chandler,Okay.,8.2
S08E21,monica,"Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.",8.2

S08E21,chandler,No don’t I beg of you!,8.2
S08E21,chandler,Really?!,8.2
S08E21,chandler,"Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.",8.2
S08E21,chandler,"Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!",8.2

S08E21,rachel,Hi! You’re back from your date!,8.2
S08E21,ross,How are you?,8.2

S08E21,ross,I liked her.,8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!",8.2
S08E21,ross,Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!,8.2
S08E21,rachel,"No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.",8.2
S08E21,ross,Why? What was wrong with her?,8.2
S08E21,rachel,There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!,8.2
S08E21,ross,"Okay, so what’s the matter?",8.2
S08E21,rachel,I don’t want you to date her!,8.2
S08E21,ross,"Why? What, what are you jealous?",8.2
S08E21,rachel,"Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",8.2
S08E21,ross,Okay.,8.2
S08E21,rachel,What?!,8.2

S08E21,rachel,NA,8.2
S08E21,ross,Do you feel better?,8.2
S08E21,rachel,"No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.",8.2
S08E21,ross,Uh Rach?,8.2
S08E21,rachel,Yeah.,8.2
S08E21,ross,Just one thing umm…,8.2
S08E21,rachel,Uh-huh.,8.2

S08E22,joey,I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited!,8.3
S08E22,monica,Are we gonna take a limo?,8.3
S08E22,joey,Sure! Why not?!,8.3
S08E22,monica,Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!",8.3
S08E22,ross,"Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here?",8.3
S08E22,rachel,You. Like you haven’t done enough.,8.3
S08E22,ross,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!",8.3
S08E22,chandler,Let’s.,8.3
S08E22,chandler,Hey! Did you have the baby yet?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.,8.3
S08E22,monica,What are you doing here so early?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"They sent me home from work. They were like, \Start your maternity leave now! Just rest",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,Or you can do volunteer work.,8.3
S08E22,joey,Hello?,8.3
S08E22,joey,One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!,8.3
S08E22,joey,Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?,8.3
S08E22,joey,Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,What-what about me?,8.3
S08E22,joey,You said you didn’t want to go.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.,8.3
S08E22,joey,Definitely not invisible.,8.3
S08E22,monica,"Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.",8.3
S08E22,monica,"Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.",8.3
S08E22,chandler,I haven’t seen this dress.,8.3
S08E22,monica,Star in a movie.,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.",8.3
S08E22,joey,Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,NA,8.3
S08E22,chandler,You really want to take me?,8.3
S08E22,joey,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",8.3
S08E22,chandler,So you’re never actually going to pay me back?,8.3
S08E22,monica,"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!",8.3
S08E22,joey,"It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.",8.3
S08E22,chandler,I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.,8.3
S08E22,joey,Thanks. That means a lot to me.,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.",8.3
S08E22,joey,NA,8.3
S08E22,chandler,NA,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink.",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her.",8.3
S08E22,monica,"She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.,8.3
S08E22,monica,"Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,You’re on!,8.3
S08E22,monica,"Okay, how much?",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,One hundred thousand dollars!,8.3
S08E22,monica,How about fifty bucks?,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,No one’s here!  Oh damnit!,8.3
S08E22,chandler,This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?,8.3
S08E22,joey,A little tall.,8.3
S08E22,chandler,What?,8.3
S08E22,joey,"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,It’s just so glamorous.,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.",8.3
S08E22,monica,Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks!,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?",8.3
S08E22,monica,Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,Fine! You’re on!,8.3
S08E22,monica,Okay.,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.",8.3
S08E22,ross,Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.,8.3
S08E22,monica,She’s in the bathroom.,8.3
S08E22,ross,"Rach, we gotta go.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,In a minute!!!,8.3
S08E22,ross,"People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"All right, all right. Let’s go!",8.3
S08E22,ross,"Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"No, I’m fine.",8.3
S08E22,ross,Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate.,8.3
S08E22,phoebe,Good God man don’t anger it.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.",8.3
S08E22,ross,Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that.,8.3
S08E22,monica,I’m actually with her on this one.,8.3
S08E22,joey,\I thought I knew who the enemy was,8.3
S08E22,joey,NA,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Ross.,8.3
S08E22,ross,Yeah?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Can I ask you something?,8.3
S08E22,ross,Uh-huh.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,When Carol was pregnant with Ben…,8.3
S08E22,ross,Mmm?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,…were you this irritating?,8.3
S08E22,ross,Wow!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Excuse me?!,8.3
S08E22,ross,"Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.,8.3
S08E22,ross,"Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!",8.3
S08E22,ross,Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?",8.3
S08E22,ross,"Oh, you’re nice to her.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,She has the drugs!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Yeah.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Eh, just a tad.",8.3
S08E22,ross,Do them!!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Well, we are ready to try anything.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Great! We will do all of those.,8.3
S08E22,ross,You’ve got to be kidding me!,8.3
S08E22,chandler,Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!,8.3
S08E22,joey,You liked it? You really liked it?,8.3
S08E22,chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!",8.3
S08E22,joey,Which part exactly?,8.3
S08E22,chandler,The whole thing! Can we go?,8.3
S08E22,joey,"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!",8.3
S08E22,joey,"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.,8.3
S08E22,joey,You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later.,8.3
S08E22,chandler,"Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!  Or, call an ambulance.",8.3
S08E22,monica,Hey!,8.3
S08E22,ross,Hey.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Hi!,8.3
S08E22,monica,What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.,8.3
S08E22,ross,"Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that,  \That will open up a can of worms.\""",8.3
S08E22,monica,"Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.",8.3
S08E22,ross,It’s sex.,8.3
S08E22,monica,Do it!,8.3
S08E22,ross,Monica!,8.3
S08E22,monica,"I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!",8.3
S08E22,phoebe,"Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.",8.3
S08E22,monica,"All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!",8.3
S08E22,ross,"Monica, what is the matter with you?",8.3
S08E22,monica,Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Why? Why today?,8.3
S08E22,monica,Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!,8.3
S08E22,ross,"What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?!",8.3
S08E22,rachel,I’ll take that bet.,8.3
S08E22,ross,What?!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!",8.3
S08E22,ross,Can I get some of that action?,8.3
S08E22,monica,Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.",8.3
S08E22,monica,"Oh, okay!",8.3
S08E22,joey,Hey! Sleeping beauty!,8.3
S08E22,chandler,Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!,8.3
S08E22,joey,"Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,I’m so sorry.,8.3
S08E22,joey,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,What?!,8.3
S08E22,joey,"Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…",8.3
S08E22,joey,"Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"I don’t know, five hundred dollars?",8.3
S08E22,joey,"Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.",8.3
S08E22,joey,"Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s…",8.3
S08E22,chandler,Do you want a calculator?,8.3
S08E22,joey,Please!,8.3
S08E22,chandler,Here!,8.3
S08E22,joey,"All right, what else?",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…",8.3
S08E22,joey,Which we’re still keeping under our hats!,8.3
S08E22,chandler,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.,8.3
S08E22,joey,"What the hell are you talking about,  \The south will rise again man.\""",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"Yes, money well spent!",8.3
S08E22,joey,"Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!",8.3
S08E22,chandler,"Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…",8.3
S08E22,joey,"Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?",8.3
S08E22,ross,"Come on, finish your enchilada.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.,8.3
S08E22,ross,"Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!  By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.",8.3
S08E22,ross,Stop it.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!",8.3
S08E22,ross,"I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.",8.3
S08E22,ross,"This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,Make love? What are you a girl?,8.3
S08E22,ross,Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.",8.3
S08E22,ross,I love when you talk dirty to me.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!  Oh God!",8.3
S08E22,ross,"Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.",8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.",8.3
S08E22,ross,Y’know what?,8.3
S08E22,rachel,What?!,8.3
S08E22,ross,Forget it.,8.3
S08E22,rachel,"Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know.  What are you doing?!",8.3
S08E22,ross,I’m getting that baby out of you!,8.3
S08E22,rachel,Oh God!,8.3

S08E23,ross,All right!  Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Yes, the hard part is truly over.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh you made it!,8.8

S08E23,rachel,"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",8.8

S08E23,rachel,"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!",8.8
S08E23,ross,…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Yeah.  Why aren’t you with Rachel?,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Right. And with who again?,8.8
S08E23,joey,God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,I know!,8.8
S08E23,joey,"I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and…  I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?",8.8
S08E23,ross,Hey. Who’s that?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,New people.,8.8
S08E23,ross,What happened to the Disgustingtons?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!",8.8
S08E23,ross,Yeah? Okay.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Ooh! Ow!!,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—",8.8
S08E23,ross,"No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.",8.8
S08E23,ross,Just ignore them.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Ross.,8.8
S08E23,ross,What? What?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,He’s looking at me.,8.8
S08E23,ross,Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!,8.8
S08E23,monica,Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!,8.8
S08E23,monica,What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?,8.8
S08E23,chandler,I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.,8.8
S08E23,monica,What?,8.8
S08E23,chandler,"Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.",8.8
S08E23,monica,We are pretty good.,8.8
S08E23,chandler,But nothing has to happen until your ready.,8.8
S08E23,monica,"Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!,8.8
S08E23,monica,What?!!,8.8
S08E23,chandler,I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.,8.8
S08E23,monica,"So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"We’re trying to get pregnant.  Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?",8.8
S08E23,monica,"Okay, hold on a sec.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,Period math?,8.8
S08E23,monica,Yeah.,8.8
S08E23,chandler,Yeah.,8.8
S08E23,monica,"Well, we could start trying. Now.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,Right here?,8.8
S08E23,monica,"No, not here. Maybe here.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!",8.8
S08E23,monica,And it’s so clean!!,8.8
S08E23,joey,Come on you stupid machine! Come on!,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Oh, it ate your money?",8.8
S08E23,joey,No.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.",8.8
S08E23,joey,All right.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,All right.,8.8
S08E23,joey,Hey I got one! I got one!,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Hi.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh down please.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.  How about you?",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh yeah! I-I would like that.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!,8.8
S08E23,joey,NA,8.8
S08E23,ross,The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!",8.8
S08E23,ross,That’s it. That’s it.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Yeah it was.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?",8.8
S08E23,joey,Dr. Drake Remoray.,8.8
S08E23,joey,Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.,8.8
S08E23,joey,Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Hands.,8.8
S08E23,joey,"Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!",8.8
S08E23,joey,"816, thank you!",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Thank you.,8.8
S08E23,joey,And what is his name?,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,NA,8.8
S08E23,monica,I think we found a place.,8.8
S08E23,chandler,Okay.,8.8
S08E23,monica,"Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights.",8.8
S08E23,monica,"Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.",8.8
S08E23,monica,Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom?,8.8
S08E23,chandler,"Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that’s him! That’s him!",8.8
S08E23,joey,Great! Go get him.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",8.8
S08E23,joey,He’s not really my type.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.",8.8
S08E23,joey,But you said he was this great guy!,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",8.8
S08E23,joey,You do attract some stinkers.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?",8.8
S08E23,ross,Just three?! I’m dilated three!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this!",8.8
S08E23,ross,Actually it’s more like this.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh stupid metric system!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh for the love of God!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh come on!!,8.8
S08E23,joey,Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.,8.8
S08E23,joey,"I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.",8.8
S08E23,joey,"That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.",8.8
S08E23,joey,Date of birth?,8.8
S08E23,joey,Age?,8.8
S08E23,joey,"I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Okay. And uh, are you married.",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?",8.8
S08E23,joey,Yes.,8.8
S08E23,joey,Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.,8.8
S08E23,joey,Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?,8.8
S08E23,joey,"Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Oooh, wrong answer.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband  he’s a lawyer!",8.8
S08E23,ross,Uh Rach…,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Go get back on that case honey!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Okay, well then bring her in.",8.8
S08E23,ross,And yet somehow it’s true!,8.8
S08E23,ross,Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!,8.8
S08E23,ross,Really?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh!,8.8
S08E23,ross,Oh there you go!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,I get it!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh we-we didn’t.,8.8
S08E23,ross,No-no. We…,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Just tell me how.,8.8
S08E23,ross,Sid you lucky deaf bastard.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,What else? What else?,8.8
S08E23,joey,"Uh, well he’s 33.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh. Ah-uh.,8.8
S08E23,joey,A widower.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh.,8.8
S08E23,joey,"He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Enter Pheebs.,8.8
S08E23,chandler,Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?,8.8
S08E23,monica,"We could, or we can have sex in it.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!",8.8
S08E23,monica,Okay mister! Fertilize me!,8.8
S08E23,monica,Does that sound like Janice?,8.8
S08E23,chandler,"If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!",8.8
S08E23,monica,Hey!,8.8
S08E23,ross,Hey!,8.8
S08E23,chandler,Hi.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh hi.,8.8
S08E23,monica,I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,8.8
S08E23,chandler,Weirdest thing. Did I hear——Mother of God it’s true!,8.8
S08E23,chandler,Jan-Janice!,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?,8.8
S08E23,chandler,What?!,8.8
S08E23,chandler,That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Somebody went to college. Wow.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Oh, I’ll get it.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?,8.8
S08E23,ross,Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,What?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Y’know what? This one is.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.",8.8
S08E23,joey,Fake? Excuse me? Hello?,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.",8.8
S08E23,joey,Right!,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.",8.8
S08E23,joey,Me neither.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,3-2-1 oh!!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.",8.8
S08E23,ross,Sweetie you’re doing great.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!,8.8
S08E23,ross,What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Don’t say, \Oh my God!\"" Oh my God what?""",8.8
S08E23,ross,What is that?,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?,8.8
S08E23,ross,Go!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"I’m sorry, I can’t!",8.8

S08E23,rachel,"Oh, she’s so tiny.  Where’d she go?",8.8
S08E23,ross,Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me.  I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"No, not yet.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Hello baby girl.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Can we come in?,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Oh, come in.",8.8

S08E23,monica,"Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.",8.8
S08E23,joey,Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,What?,8.8
S08E23,joey,"Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.",8.8
S08E23,monica,What’s the matter?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.,8.8
S08E23,joey,What’s the matter now?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,I was reliving it.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Ohhh.,8.8
S08E23,chandler,"So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella.  What?",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,So then I guess Ferdinad is out.,8.8
S08E23,joey,What was the other one Ross?,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Umm, Delilah.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.,8.8
S08E23,ross,"So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Yay!,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Well what are we going to do?,8.8
S08E23,monica,"It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,You do?,8.8
S08E23,monica,"Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Well tell us! What are they?,8.8
S08E23,monica,"Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,And if it’s a girl?,8.8
S08E23,monica,I don’t want to say.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!",8.8
S08E23,monica,Okay. It’s Emma.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,See? I don’t want it.,8.8
S08E23,monica,Take it.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,What?,8.8
S08E23,monica,It’s clearly an Emma.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh honey, but you love that name.",8.8
S08E23,monica,"Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean…  You want a cousin right now?!",8.8
S08E23,chandler,That was amazing.,8.8
S08E23,monica,"I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.",8.8
S08E23,chandler,"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh, I’m fine.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Really?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.",8.8
S08E23,ross,Hey Janice!,8.8
S08E23,ross,Who’s this little guy?,8.8
S08E23,ross,No-no. No.,8.8
S08E23,ross,Okay.,8.8
S08E23,ross,Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Uh-huh.  Y’know what I was, I was thinking about?",8.8
S08E23,ross,Huh?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Right.,8.8
S08E23,ross,I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up.  They didn’t have any sodas?",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,That’s all right.  And so it begins.,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Is she in there?,8.8
S08E23,ross,"Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Oh!,8.8
S08E23,ross,Look at Emma!,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",8.8
S08E23,ross,It’s…it’s complicated okay?,8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",8.8
S08E23,ross,"Yeah, exactly.",8.8
S08E23,phoebe,Right.  Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.,8.8
S08E23,joey,Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  What’s the matter?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,Nothing.,8.8

S08E23,rachel,"Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",8.8
S08E23,rachel,"I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",8.8
S08E23,joey,"Yeah, I guess so.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,8.8
S08E23,joey,"Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.",8.8
S08E23,rachel,Joey. Honey what would I do without you?,8.8
S08E23,joey,You don’t have to worry about that okay?,8.8
S08E23,rachel,"Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.",8.8

S09E01,rachel,"Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",8.6
S09E01,ross,"Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?",8.6

S09E01,chandler,Okay. Wow.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want, but  I really want to talk to you.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"I know, I still need to talk to you.",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Oh hey but, before you guys do that  I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.",8.6

S09E01,phoebe,"Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?",8.6
S09E01,ross,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.",8.6
S09E01,ross,Yeah right.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.",8.6
S09E01,ross,What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",8.6
S09E01,chandler,Sure.,8.6
S09E01,joey,Dude I just did something terrible.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,8.6
S09E01,joey,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",8.6
S09E01,chandler,What?! Why does she think that?,8.6
S09E01,joey,Because it kinda looked like I did.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Again, what?!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…",8.6
S09E01,chandler,As we all are at some point during the day.,8.6
S09E01,joey,It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,8.6
S09E01,chandler,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,8.6
S09E01,joey,I guess.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,8.6
S09E01,joey,I know! I know it’s awful.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Well, what did she say?",8.6
S09E01,joey,She said yes.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,Does Ross know?,8.6
S09E01,joey,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",8.6
S09E01,chandler,Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.,8.6
S09E01,joey,"Oh, I like that. Yeah…",8.6
S09E01,chandler,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",8.6
S09E01,joey,NA,8.6
S09E01,monica,I want a baby.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?",8.6
S09E01,chandler,"I’m so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay.",8.6
S09E01,monica,Deal!,8.6
S09E01,ross,Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!,8.6
S09E01,ross,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?",8.6
S09E01,ross,NA,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Hey!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Hi.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Are you all right?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Oh my God! He did it?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,And you really think this is a good idea?,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,Really?! Even Ross?,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Especially Ross!,8.6
S09E01,joey,NA,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back.",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"There he goes, your fianc�e.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,I guess so.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,I can’t say that I’m surprised.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Dad, what are you doing?",8.6
S09E01,joey,"It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.",8.6
S09E01,ross,No!,8.6
S09E01,ross,Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom.,8.6
S09E01,joey,NA,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Hello sir, you know Monica.",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,Hey!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?",8.6
S09E01,joey,NA,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",8.6
S09E01,joey,Dear Lord.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Y’know, I don’t really know her.",8.6
S09E01,joey,Are you kidding me?!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,8.6
S09E01,joey,I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Oh hey! Wait up!,8.6
S09E01,ross,Hi!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",8.6
S09E01,ross,What?,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",8.6
S09E01,ross,"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,8.6
S09E01,ross,I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?",8.6
S09E01,ross,"No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,And so engaged.,8.6
S09E01,ross,What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,8.6
S09E01,ross,I didn’t give her that ring!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Really?,8.6
S09E01,ross,No!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,So whose ring is it?,8.6
S09E01,ross,It’s mine.,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,Is it an engagement ring?,8.6
S09E01,ross,Yes!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,But you didn’t give it to her?,8.6
S09E01,ross,No!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,But you were going to propose?,8.6
S09E01,ross,No!!,8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",8.6
S09E01,ross,"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",8.6
S09E01,ross,"Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?",8.6
S09E01,phoebe,"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",8.6
S09E01,ross,Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Look, we can’t stay in here forever.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!",8.6
S09E01,chandler,"This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.",8.6
S09E01,monica,Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.",8.6
S09E01,monica,It wasn’t fun?!,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.",8.6
S09E01,monica,Daddy?!,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.",8.6
S09E01,monica,Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.,8.6
S09E01,monica,I don’t feel good right now.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.",8.6
S09E01,monica,Hey.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Hey. I need to tell you something.,8.6
S09E01,monica,"Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,Joey asked me marry him.,8.6
S09E01,monica,What?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Joey proposed to me.,8.6
S09E01,monica,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Well, I-I said yes.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.",8.6
S09E01,monica,You can’t marry him!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.,8.6
S09E01,monica,Well do you love him?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Sure.,8.6
S09E01,monica,Sure?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yeah, I mean whatever.",8.6
S09E01,monica,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",8.6
S09E01,chandler,You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?,8.6
S09E01,joey,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.",8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!",8.6
S09E01,joey,I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.,8.6
S09E01,chandler,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,8.6
S09E01,joey,"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.",8.6
S09E01,chandler,"Okay, look, just do it gently.",8.6
S09E01,joey,"You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.",8.6
S09E01,ross,Hey.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Hey.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,Surprised?,8.6
S09E01,ross,"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,I know.,8.6
S09E01,ross,I don’t think you do.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.",8.6
S09E01,ross,Joey proposed to you?,8.6
S09E01,joey,I can come back.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?",8.6
S09E01,joey,No.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Yes you did!,8.6
S09E01,joey,"Actually, technically, I didn’t.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,Well then why did you give me a ring?,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?",8.6
S09E01,joey,"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yes, you did!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"No, I didn’t!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yes, you did!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"No, I didn’t!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yes, you did! And don’t you say, \No",8.6
S09E01,joey,Ahhh!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.,8.6
S09E01,ross,Whoa! You were down on one knee?,8.6
S09E01,joey,"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!",8.6
S09E01,ross,Then what did happen?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yeah, what did happen?",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yeah, but you said, \Will you marry me?\""",8.6
S09E01,joey,"No, I didn’t!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yes, you did!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"No, I didn’t!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t!  Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!",8.6
S09E01,ross,"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!",8.6
S09E01,joey,I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.",8.6
S09E01,ross,What?!,8.6
S09E01,rachel,You were gonna propose to me?,8.6
S09E01,ross,Uhh… No.,8.6
S09E01,joey,"Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}",8.6
S09E01,ross,"But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Dude, step up! I proposed.",8.6
S09E01,ross,"No, you didn’t!",8.6
S09E01,joey,Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,Okay.,8.6
S09E01,ross,I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!,8.6
S09E01,joey,I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!",8.6
S09E01,joey,"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!",8.6
S09E01,rachel,Oh my God!,8.6
S09E01,ross,What?,8.6
S09E01,rachel,"She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!",8.6

S09E01,ross,We’re so lucky.,8.6
S09E01,rachel,We really are.,8.6
S09E01,ross,"Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…",8.6

S09E02,ross,"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?",8.5
S09E02,rachel,That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.,8.5
S09E02,ross,"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.",8.5
S09E02,rachel,Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.,8.5
S09E02,ross,"Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah!",8.5

S09E03,rachel,"Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?",8.2
S09E03,ross,"Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.",8.2
S09E03,rachel,Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!,8.2
S09E03,ross,"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.",8.2
S09E03,rachel,"What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.",8.2
S09E03,ross,"You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!",8.2
S09E03,rachel,"Wiener, Wiener!!!",8.2

S09E03,phoebe,"Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.",8.2
S09E03,joey,No.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"Come on, give me something. What's his name?",8.2
S09E03,joey,Mike.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Mike? Okay! What's his last name?,8.2
S09E03,joey,Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.",8.2
S09E03,joey,Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...  There's no guy in there!,8.2
S09E03,rachel,"It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?",8.2
S09E03,monica,Excuse me?,8.2
S09E03,chandler,I know what she's talking about.,8.2
S09E03,rachel,"We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.",8.2
S09E03,monica,Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?,8.2
S09E03,rachel,Ross said he died.,8.2
S09E03,monica,"He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.",8.2
S09E03,rachel,"Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.",8.2
S09E03,monica,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.",8.2
S09E03,chandler,He saw a therapist?,8.2
S09E03,monica,"Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.",8.2
S09E03,rachel,Why? What was it?,8.2
S09E03,monica,That I was going to eat him.,8.2
S09E03,joey,MIKE!!!,8.2

S09E03,phoebe,"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?",8.2
S09E03,joey,From school.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?",8.2
S09E03,joey,"Mike, 'attorney at law'!",8.2
S09E03,joey,What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...",8.2
S09E03,joey,Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.,8.2
S09E03,joey,"No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.",8.2
S09E03,monica,Hey!,8.2
S09E03,chandler,Hey!,8.2

S09E03,monica,That's so sweet. Find anything?,8.2
S09E03,chandler,Slim Pickings.,8.2
S09E03,monica,"Nothing, huh?",8.2
S09E03,chandler,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.",8.2
S09E03,monica,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.,8.2
S09E03,chandler,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.,8.2
S09E03,monica,"Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.",8.2
S09E03,chandler,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.,8.2
S09E03,monica,'I'll take it!',8.2
S09E03,rachel,"Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.",8.2
S09E03,ross,Thanks doctor.,8.2
S09E03,ross,You even have to ask?!  He is alive!,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.",8.2
S09E03,joey,"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.",8.2
S09E03,joey,"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!",8.2
S09E03,joey,"Please, we're trying to have a conversation.",8.2
S09E03,phoebe,What?!,8.2
S09E03,joey,What?!,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Do you not know each other?,8.2
S09E03,joey,"Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!",8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?",8.2
S09E03,joey,What are you doing? I said seven!  Argh!!!,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?",8.2
S09E03,joey,"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.",8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.",8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Who are you kidding?  You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!,8.2
S09E03,joey,"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!",8.2
S09E03,phoebe,I'm out of here,8.2
S09E03,joey,You're leaving too?,8.2
S09E03,joey,Good night!,8.2
S09E03,chandler,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.",8.2
S09E03,monica,You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.,8.2
S09E03,chandler,What?,8.2
S09E03,monica,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.",8.2
S09E03,chandler,How far outside?,8.2
S09E03,monica,Manhattan.,8.2
S09E03,chandler,And you're thinking of taking it?  new job.,8.2
S09E03,monica,"I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",8.2
S09E03,chandler,What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?,8.2
S09E03,monica,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",8.2
S09E03,chandler,I think you should take the job.,8.2
S09E03,monica,Really?,8.2
S09E03,chandler,Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.,8.2
S09E03,monica,That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!,8.2

S09E03,rachel,I know.  I don't care!,8.2
S09E03,monica,Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?,8.2
S09E03,ross,He's a brilliant diagnostician!,8.2
S09E03,chandler,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?,8.2
S09E03,rachel,"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.",8.2
S09E03,ross,"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'",8.2
S09E03,chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,8.2
S09E03,ross,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",8.2
S09E03,chandler,That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!,8.2
S09E03,ross,It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Sure.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Why did you go along with that?,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,"That's true.  Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?",8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Prove it.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.,8.2
S09E03,phoebe,Uhuh.,8.2

S09E03,ross,"Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.",8.2
S09E03,ross,With the circus? He's behind the elephant.,8.2
S09E03,ross,"Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.",8.2

S09E06,monica,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.,8.4
S09E06,monica,"Oh, well... That had been your window.",8.4
S09E06,monica,Really? The scientist guy?,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,Really? Chandler?,8.4
S09E06,monica,Continue...,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.",8.4
S09E06,monica,Phoebe!,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"I know!  Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!",8.4
S09E06,monica,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?",8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.",8.4
S09E06,monica,What are you gonna do?,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...",8.4

S09E06,monica,Heeeeeey!,8.4
S09E06,chandler,Hey!,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,Hey!,8.4
S09E06,chandler,"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.",8.4
S09E06,monica,Was your cabin pressurised?,8.4
S09E06,chandler,And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,Okay.,8.4
S09E06,chandler,"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?",8.4
S09E06,monica,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?",8.4
S09E06,chandler,"Yeah, he came up...",8.4
S09E06,monica,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.",8.4
S09E06,chandler,Were you there?,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...",8.4
S09E06,rachel,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is...",8.4

S09E06,ross,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!",8.4
S09E06,rachel,"So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.",8.4
S09E06,ross,"Because, it's weird!",8.4
S09E06,rachel,Why?,8.4
S09E06,ross,What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...,8.4
S09E06,rachel,Yes?,8.4

S09E06,joey,Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.,8.4
S09E06,chandler,"Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.",8.4
S09E06,joey,"I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?",8.4
S09E06,chandler,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.,8.4
S09E06,joey,Seriously? She actually said that?,8.4
S09E06,chandler,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?,8.4

S09E06,phoebe,Oof...,8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"Oh, wait, wait!",8.4
S09E06,phoebe,"No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.",8.4

S09E06,phoebe,"Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...",8.4
S09E06,phoebe,I mean...,8.4

S09E06,phoebe,"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...",8.4
S09E06,rachel,Hi...,8.4

S09E06,rachel,What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?,8.4
S09E06,ross,These are amazing!,8.4
S09E06,rachel,Sandy made Madeleines.,8.4

S09E06,rachel,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.",8.4

S09E06,joey,Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...,8.4
S09E06,ross,Thank you!,8.4
S09E06,joey,That's like a woman wanting to be a...,8.4
S09E06,ross,...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?,8.4
S09E06,monica,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?,8.4
S09E06,joey,"Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?",8.4
S09E06,monica,"Yeah, so?",8.4
S09E06,ross,Wow!,8.4
S09E06,joey,Really? Do you not know Chandler?,8.4
S09E06,monica,"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...",8.4

S09E06,chandler,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.",8.4
S09E06,monica,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!",8.4
S09E06,chandler,What is so funny about that?,8.4

S09E06,ross,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.",8.4
S09E06,ross,Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?,8.4
S09E06,ross,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.",8.4
S09E06,rachel,Huh ha ha!,8.4

S09E07,monica,What do you do with your money now?,8.7
S09E07,joey,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!",8.7
S09E07,chandler,Do you have any ideas?,8.7

S09E07,joey,NA,8.7
S09E07,monica,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.  That's right, I know some stuff!",8.7
S09E07,joey,"Real estate, huh? Hmmm...",8.7
S09E07,monica,"Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!",8.7

S09E07,monica,"Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Really? That hadn't occurred to me.,8.7
S09E07,monica,"They just gonna love you, just be yourself.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!,8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Oh yeah, she can't be herself.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say \neither\"".""",8.7
S09E07,monica,"I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.",8.7
S09E07,monica,You went out with Wallis Pincer?,8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Uh, he took the SAT's for me.",8.7
S09E07,monica,I knew you didn't get a 1400!,8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,So... now... What about with Mike's mom?,8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.",8.7
S09E07,monica,She said WHAT?,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,NA,8.7
S09E07,rachel,Hi.,8.7

S09E07,ross,Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.,8.7
S09E07,rachel,You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?,8.7
S09E07,ross,"Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.",8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?",8.7
S09E07,ross,"I uhm... Well, I sang...",8.7
S09E07,rachel,You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?,8.7
S09E07,ross,"But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.",8.7
S09E07,rachel,owwwww...,8.7
S09E07,ross,Please don't take her away from me!,8.7
S09E07,joey,Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.,8.7
S09E07,chandler,So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,mmm That's enough about you!,8.7
S09E07,joey,Is there anything we should know about the apartment?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,"No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.",8.7
S09E07,joey,"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?",8.7
S09E07,chandler,"We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man!",8.7
S09E07,joey,"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah, I could see it.",8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!",8.7
S09E07,joey,What?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.,8.7
S09E07,joey,Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape...,8.7
S09E07,chandler,Get there faster!,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,I'm wearing pantyhose!,8.7

S09E07,phoebe,I'm trying to get your parents to like me.,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Got it! It... It's hard to stop...,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,So... where does everyone summer?,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,God! God! This is not going well.,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Yeah I bet! Look out!,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Oh my God, are you okay?",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,I'm so sorry!,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"I really, really am sorry.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...",8.7
S09E07,chandler,"I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?",8.7
S09E07,joey,"Hey dude, what's up?",8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!",8.7
S09E07,joey,Did you take that tape?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?",8.7
S09E07,joey,I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,Some girl...!?,8.7
S09E07,joey,She hot?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,Yeah...!?,8.7
S09E07,joey,How did she get me to settle down?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?",8.7
S09E07,chandler,Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,8.7
S09E07,joey,What? Whoo... What?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?",8.7
S09E07,joey,"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...",8.7
S09E07,chandler,Why am I hearing cheering?,8.7
S09E07,joey,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.",8.7
S09E07,chandler,Football? Just football?,8.7
S09E07,joey,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.",8.7
S09E07,chandler,It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What are you doing?,8.7
S09E07,joey,You don't wanna see what I just saw!,8.7
S09E07,monica,What are you guys doing?,8.7
S09E07,rachel,Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...,8.7
S09E07,ross,Hey!,8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...",8.7
S09E07,ross,"Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?",8.7
S09E07,rachel,"Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...",8.7
S09E07,ross,You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?,8.7
S09E07,rachel,Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Oh, Pervert Parade?",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Oh God! Is that veal?,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,"Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...",8.7
S09E07,monica,So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!,8.7
S09E07,monica,That tape was never meant to be seen by...  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.,8.7
S09E07,joey,NA,8.7
S09E07,monica,Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",8.7
S09E07,monica,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,8.7
S09E07,chandler,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,8.7
S09E07,monica,"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.",8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!",8.7
S09E07,monica,"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.",8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...",8.7
S09E07,monica,Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!,8.7
S09E07,chandler,"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.",8.7
S09E07,monica,THAT'S NOT ME!,8.7
S09E07,chandler,What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!,8.7
S09E07,monica,That bastard taped over me!,8.7
S09E07,chandler,Is that a problem?,8.7
S09E07,monica,"I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!",8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Yeah... The woman you what?,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,I love you too...,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,YEAH...! How great is this...?,8.7
S09E07,phoebe,Okay.,8.7
S09E07,ross,"She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.",8.7

S09E07,ross,Shake it!,8.7
S09E07,rachel,Shake it!,8.7
S09E07,ross,Shake it!,8.7
S09E07,rachel,Shake that nasty butt...,8.7
S09E07,ross,Baby got back,8.7
S09E07,rachel,"One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...",8.7
S09E07,ross,Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!,8.7
S09E08,monica,"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",8.8
S09E08,monica,"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",8.8
S09E08,monica,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,What is the point of having them if we never use them?,8.8
S09E08,monica,"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",8.8
S09E08,chandler,I will explain it to her.,8.8
S09E08,monica,"<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.",8.8
S09E08,joey,"wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!,8.8
S09E08,joey,Oh my God!,8.8
S09E08,chandler,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?,8.8
S09E08,joey,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,What are you going to do?,8.8
S09E08,joey,I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said \Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp,8.8
S09E08,chandler,Well you proved them wrong.,8.8
S09E08,ross,A lot of people are thankful for those.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Who is it?,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Hide my rings.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Um... hi.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Aw.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,I haven't seen you in like.. a year.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,mh hmm..,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Uh.... its Emma.,8.8
S09E08,ross,Hey Amy.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Oh Amy, you remember Ross.",8.8
S09E08,ross,That was me.,8.8
S09E08,monica,Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..",8.8
S09E08,monica,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Why?,8.8
S09E08,monica,"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!",8.8
S09E08,joey,Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Hey, what's going on Joe?",8.8
S09E08,joey,I.. I.. I need a good lie.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Oh okay. How about the whole \man walking on the moon\"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!""",8.8
S09E08,joey,"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",8.8
S09E08,joey,I do not.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",8.8
S09E08,joey,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said \Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's\"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. \""Joey you stink at lying.\"" What am I going to do?""",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.",8.8
S09E08,joey,"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",8.8
S09E08,joey,"Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"\Pick up grandma at the airport\""?""",8.8
S09E08,joey,Oh.. man..,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross' hand for support>,8.8
S09E08,ross,"Sure, we don't live there but...",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,God she is unbelievable.,8.8
S09E08,ross,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,What? What happened?,8.8
S09E08,ross,Don't say that.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?",8.8
S09E08,ross,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?",8.8
S09E08,rachel,Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,8.8
S09E08,ross,"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",8.8
S09E08,ross,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",8.8
S09E08,joey,"Pheebs, I still need some help here",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",8.8
S09E08,joey,Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Oh we just put her down for a nap.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,Thats a great movie. <she claps>,8.8
S09E08,ross,Emma.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,PHOE-BE.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.",8.8
S09E08,ross,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,8.8
S09E08,monica,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",8.8
S09E08,monica,Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,8.8
S09E08,monica,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>",8.8
S09E08,joey,Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,8.8
S09E08,monica,"No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",8.8
S09E08,joey,I can't believe I won.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Monica is Ross' sister.,8.8
S09E08,monica,That was me.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,8.8
S09E08,monica,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",8.8
S09E08,rachel,Well actually...,8.8
S09E08,chandler,Actually what?,8.8
S09E08,ross,"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,What?,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",8.8
S09E08,joey,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",8.8
S09E08,ross,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,8.8
S09E08,monica,"Thats not how you see me, is it?",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",8.8
S09E08,ross,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.,8.8
S09E08,ross,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",8.8
S09E08,joey,"I lie better then that, right?",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,There's your movie! <claps>,8.8
S09E08,monica,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,8.8
S09E08,monica,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",8.8
S09E08,monica,No you learn these things. You grow into it.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",8.8
S09E08,monica,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \Go to your room! You're grounded\""?""",8.8
S09E08,monica,"Can you hear me say \You're grounded\""?""",8.8
S09E08,chandler,You said that to me last week.,8.8
S09E08,monica,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,8.8
S09E08,joey,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Ooh, what happened?",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,No! Nothing with a raccoon.,8.8
S09E08,joey,"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>",8.8
S09E08,monica,Oh wait.. What are you doing?,8.8
S09E08,joey,Setting the table.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,8.8
S09E08,monica,Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.,8.8
S09E08,ross,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,8.8
S09E08,rachel,What? What carrer?,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.,8.8
S09E08,ross,Emma.,8.8
S09E08,joey,ooh oooh..,8.8
S09E08,rachel,uh huh.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",8.8
S09E08,rachel,Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,You take that back.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Take it back!,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Heey man, I work out.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,I do pilates.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Bring it on!,8.8
S09E08,monica,Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Did you just push me?,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,8.8
S09E08,joey,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,Ew! Gross.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Mon, I'm so sorry.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",8.8
S09E08,ross,"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Oh yeah? Well thanks.,8.8
S09E08,ross,"So, so now do I get Joey?",8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",8.8
S09E08,rachel,Are you okay Mon?,8.8
S09E08,monica,uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,It's all right. You can mourn.,8.8
S09E08,joey,"Actually its not pies, its just pie.",8.8
S09E08,monica,I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,"Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",8.8
S09E08,rachel,Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.,8.8
S09E08,rachel,She needs changing.,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Nope...,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,"Broke them all, huh?",8.8
S09E08,chandler,Yep...,8.8
S09E08,phoebe,You gonna tell her?,8.8
S09E08,chandler,"Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.",8.8
S09E08,monica,Like only if the queen comes?,8.8
S09E08,chandler,Maybe not even then.,8.8
S09E08,joey,"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.",8.8
S09E08,monica,Bye plates!,8.8
S09E08,joey,"Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?",8.8
S09E08,monica,What? Something happened with the plates?,8.8
S09E08,joey,Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...,8.8
S09E09,chandler,Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?,8.2
S09E09,chandler,Chandler Bing.,8.2
S09E09,joey,Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?,8.2

S09E09,monica,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.",8.2

S09E10,phoebe,"Oh, that's it?  A great idea! Oh yeah.",7.5
S09E10,rachel,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",7.5
S09E10,chandler,"If I help, we can find 'em faster!",7.5

S09E10,chandler,How drunk are you?,7.5

S09E10,monica,Okay!,7.5
S09E10,monica,Y'know what's weird?,7.5
S09E10,chandler,What?,7.5
S09E10,monica,This doesn't feel weird!,7.5

S09E10,chandler,Two!,7.5
S09E10,monica,Two!,7.5
S09E10,chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,7.5
S09E10,monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",7.5
S09E10,chandler,Eh!,7.5
S09E10,chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",7.5
S09E10,monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.",7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.",7.5
S09E10,monica,I think you're better than you think you are.,7.5

S09E10,monica,Yeah.  Don't do the dance.,7.5
S09E10,chandler,Right!,7.5
S09E10,monica,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",7.5
S09E10,monica,You're so efficient. I love you!,7.5

S09E10,chandler,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.",7.5
S09E10,monica,That'll work!,7.5
S09E10,chandler,I don't think so.,7.5

S09E10,monica,Ohh.,7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Okay, one thing at a time.",7.5
S09E10,monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",7.5
S09E10,chandler,Ehh.,7.5
S09E10,monica,"Eh, you work for that.",7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",7.5
S09E10,monica,You do?!,7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.",7.5
S09E10,monica,"Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",7.5
S09E10,monica,You thought about that?,7.5
S09E10,chandler,Yeah.,7.5
S09E10,monica,How many kids were we gonna have?,7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",7.5
S09E10,monica,What else did you think about?,7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",7.5
S09E10,monica,"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",7.5
S09E10,chandler,Sure you do.,7.5

S09E10,ross,"What, you, you really quit your job?",7.5
S09E10,chandler,"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?",7.5

S09E10,chandler,I have *not* thought this through!,7.5

S09E11,phoebe,Joey.,8
S09E11,joey,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!",8
S09E11,phoebe,Who dies?,8
S09E11,joey,Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.,8
S09E11,phoebe,"Yes, doctor.",8
S09E11,joey,Okay.,8
S09E11,phoebe,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",8
S09E11,phoebe,"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",8
S09E11,phoebe,"Okay, from the top, people!",8
S09E11,rachel,"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",8
S09E11,ross,"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...",8
S09E11,rachel,"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",8
S09E11,ross,What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.,8
S09E11,rachel,"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",8
S09E11,ross,Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.,8
S09E11,rachel,"Come on, I don't know what else to do.",8
S09E11,ross,"Fine, fine.",8
S09E11,rachel,Ross?,8
S09E11,ross,Huh?,8
S09E11,rachel,You're pretty.,8
S09E11,chandler,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.",8
S09E11,ross,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,8
S09E11,chandler,Yeah.,8
S09E11,ross,Good-bye.,8
S09E11,monica,Didn't see you there Geller.,8
S09E11,chandler,"Yeah, Ross is here so...",8
S09E11,ross,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",8
S09E11,monica,We're gonna have sex.,8
S09E11,ross,I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.,8
S09E11,monica,Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.,8
S09E11,ross,Pants off Bing!,8
S09E11,rachel,"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",8
S09E11,rachel,"Hey, they were popular when I left!",8
S09E11,rachel,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",8
S09E11,rachel,"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!",8
S09E11,rachel,Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?,8
S09E11,rachel,"Fine, I will.  Alright, fill me in!",8
S09E11,ross,Hey.,8
S09E11,chandler,Hey.,8
S09E11,ross,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,8
S09E11,chandler,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",8
S09E11,monica,"Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",8
S09E11,ross,Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!,8
S09E11,monica,But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,8
S09E11,chandler,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",8
S09E11,monica,What are you talking about?,8
S09E11,chandler,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,8
S09E11,monica,What!? You faked it?,8
S09E11,ross,"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual",8
S09E11,phoebe,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",8
S09E11,joey,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",8
S09E11,phoebe,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",8
S09E11,joey,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",8
S09E11,phoebe,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",8
S09E11,joey,Nice.,8
S09E11,phoebe,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,8
S09E11,joey,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",8
S09E11,phoebe,About what?,8
S09E11,joey,He slept with you and then never called you.,8
S09E11,phoebe,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,8
S09E11,phoebe,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",8
S09E11,joey,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",8
S09E11,rachel,"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!",8
S09E11,rachel,"Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",8
S09E11,rachel,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",8
S09E11,rachel,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!",8
S09E11,rachel,"No, I can't, I have a baby.",8
S09E11,rachel,Why would you do that?,8
S09E11,rachel,That's really nice.,8
S09E11,rachel,"Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",8
S09E11,joey,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,8
S09E11,joey,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",8
S09E11,joey,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",8
S09E11,phoebe,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,8
S09E11,joey,You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,8
S09E11,phoebe,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",8
S09E11,joey,What?,8
S09E11,phoebe,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",8
S09E11,joey,"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",8
S09E11,monica,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,8
S09E11,chandler,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,8
S09E11,monica,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",8
S09E11,chandler,"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.",8
S09E11,monica,Like a month?,8
S09E11,chandler,Or a year?,8
S09E11,monica,"Really, you want to wait a year?",8
S09E11,chandler,"It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. \Pants. Like shorts",8
S09E11,monica,I really wanna have a baby.,8
S09E11,chandler,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",8
S09E11,monica,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",8
S09E11,chandler,I quit and you learn what I do?,8
S09E11,monica,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",8
S09E11,chandler,I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.,8
S09E11,monica,"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",8
S09E11,chandler,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,8
S09E11,monica,"Yes, please!",8
S09E11,chandler,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",8
S09E11,monica,I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,8
S09E12,chandler,Hey,8
S09E12,joey,Hey. So where's Mon?,8
S09E12,chandler,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",8
S09E12,joey,And you're not helping?,8
S09E12,chandler,"I tried, but apparantly singing \I will survive\"" in a helium voice - not helping.""",8
S09E12,ross,Hey you guys!,8
S09E12,rachel,"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",8
S09E12,ross,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.",8
S09E12,ross,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",8
S09E12,joey,"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",8
S09E12,rachel,"OK, thank you.",8
S09E12,joey,"Yeah, you too.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",8
S09E12,ross,Yeah.,8
S09E12,chandler,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",8
S09E12,rachel,What? You really think she's hot?,8
S09E12,chandler,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,8
S09E12,rachel,And Joey?,8
S09E12,joey,How do you think she's doing?,8
S09E12,rachel,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,8
S09E12,ross,"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",8
S09E12,rachel,Thank you!,8
S09E12,chandler,Now that Rachel's gone?,8
S09E12,rachel,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,8
S09E12,phoebe,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",8
S09E12,phoebe,"No. It starts with a \v\"" and ends with an \""x\"". Helpfully with a \""to\"" in the middle.""",8
S09E12,phoebe,What?,8
S09E12,phoebe,"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.",8
S09E12,phoebe,"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",8
S09E12,phoebe,What are those?,8
S09E12,phoebe,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",8
S09E12,phoebe,"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.",8
S09E12,rachel,Hello.,8
S09E12,rachel,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",8
S09E12,rachel,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Hello.  I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.",8
S09E12,rachel,I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. \Oh Gavin",8
S09E12,rachel,"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",8
S09E12,rachel,"It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just \Tag\"". You know",8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",8
S09E12,rachel,"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",8
S09E12,joey,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",8
S09E12,joey,Sure.,8
S09E12,monica,Would you stop staring at her?,8
S09E12,chandler,I wasn't staring. I was leering.,8
S09E12,monica,What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,8
S09E12,ross,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",8
S09E12,chandler,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,8
S09E12,monica,"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",8
S09E12,ross,"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...",8
S09E12,monica,They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,8
S09E12,rachel,"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",8
S09E12,joey,Why not?,8
S09E12,rachel,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",8
S09E12,joey,"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.",8
S09E12,ross,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",8
S09E12,joey,"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",8
S09E12,ross,"What are you, a child?",8
S09E12,joey,Yes!,8
S09E12,ross,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",8
S09E12,joey,Fine.,8
S09E12,monica,NA,8
S09E12,phoebe,Hey Mikey,8
S09E12,phoebe,What are you doing?,8
S09E12,phoebe,To kill Bob??,8
S09E12,phoebe,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",8
S09E12,phoebe,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!",8
S09E12,phoebe,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",8
S09E12,phoebe,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!",8
S09E12,phoebe,Suzie?,8
S09E12,ross,Whazzup??,8
S09E12,chandler,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",8
S09E12,ross,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",8
S09E12,chandler,You don't trust him?,8
S09E12,ross,"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the \hot nanny\"".""",8
S09E12,chandler,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",8
S09E12,ross,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",8
S09E12,chandler,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.",8
S09E12,ross,"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",8
S09E12,chandler,Picturing that tree?,8
S09E12,ross,"I am, yes.",8
S09E12,chandler,"Where you going, Joe?",8
S09E12,joey,For a walk.,8
S09E12,chandler,Oh. You mind if I join you?,8
S09E12,joey,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",8
S09E12,chandler,Your thoughts? Plural?,8
S09E12,joey,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",8
S09E12,chandler,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",8
S09E12,joey,"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",8
S09E12,chandler,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",8
S09E12,joey,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,8
S09E12,chandler,Great novels?,8
S09E12,joey,Fine ... mediocre porn,8
S09E12,rachel,Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!,8
S09E12,rachel,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",8
S09E12,rachel,If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you \momma's boy\""",8
S09E12,monica,Hey Rach!,8
S09E12,rachel,Hi!,8
S09E12,monica,Ready for your birthday lunch?,8
S09E12,rachel,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.",8
S09E12,monica,Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?,8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",8
S09E12,rachel,Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,8
S09E12,monica,You were just being so nice to him!,8
S09E12,rachel,I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,8
S09E12,rachel,"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",8
S09E12,monica,Right there! That was so fake!,8
S09E12,rachel,Shh!,8
S09E12,rachel,"I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.",8
S09E12,monica,"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",8
S09E12,rachel,"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",8
S09E12,monica,Does he?,8
S09E12,rachel,What?,8
S09E12,monica,Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?,8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys see in her?",8
S09E12,monica,Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!,8
S09E12,joey,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",8
S09E12,rachel,"Yeah, sure!",8
S09E12,joey,Oh ...,8
S09E12,monica,"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, give me!",8
S09E12,phoebe,"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",8
S09E12,rachel,"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",8
S09E12,monica,So this is what a stroke feels like.,8
S09E12,phoebe,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",8
S09E12,rachel,Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,8
S09E12,phoebe,"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",8
S09E12,rachel,"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",8
S09E12,phoebe,"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.",8
S09E12,ross,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,8
S09E12,chandler,"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",8
S09E12,ross,We have to stop them before something happens!,8
S09E12,chandler,NA,8
S09E12,joey,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",8
S09E12,joey,"Oh, I didn't go to college.",8
S09E12,joey,Molly ... people don't study acting ...,8
S09E12,ross,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",8
S09E12,ross,Thanx.,8
S09E12,joey,Will the stable boy never get the princess??,8
S09E12,ross,"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?",8
S09E12,joey,"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",8
S09E12,joey,Ok,8
S09E12,ross,"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",8
S09E12,ross,"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.",8
S09E12,joey,"It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",8
S09E12,phoebe,"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.",8
S09E12,phoebe,"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",8
S09E12,phoebe,Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,8
S09E12,phoebe,No.  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?,8
S09E12,phoebe,"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.",8
S09E12,phoebe,You must think I'm crazy.,8
S09E12,phoebe,"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't told you about that yet, have I?",8
S09E12,monica,Hey!,8
S09E12,rachel,"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",8
S09E12,monica,"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?",8
S09E12,rachel,"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",8
S09E12,monica,"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .",8
S09E12,rachel,Mmm hmm.,8
S09E12,monica,"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.",8
S09E12,rachel,No.,8
S09E12,rachel,"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...",8
S09E12,monica,"Again, you're welcome.",8
S09E12,rachel,"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?",8
S09E12,rachel,"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . \From Gavin\""",8
S09E12,rachel,"Awww, awww, it's beautiful.",8
S09E12,rachel,"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",8
S09E12,rachel,Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,8
S09E12,rachel,You do?,8

S09E12,chandler,"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.",8
S09E12,monica,Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!,8

S09E13,chandler,Hey!,8.2
S09E13,ross,Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?,8.2
S09E13,chandler,Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever,8.2
S09E13,ross,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?,8.2
S09E13,chandler,No!,8.2
S09E13,ross,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.,8.2
S09E13,chandler,Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said,8.2
S09E13,ross,"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,",8.2
S09E13,chandler,So are you gonna...talk to her?,8.2
S09E13,ross,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",8.2
S09E13,chandler,"You know when \That's fine\"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!""",8.2
S09E13,ross,No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know,8.2
S09E13,chandler,No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?,8.2
S09E13,ross,I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.,8.2
S09E13,chandler,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",8.2
S09E13,ross,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental",8.2
S09E13,chandler,Why did I get married?!,8.2
S09E13,joey,Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Well it depends.,8.2
S09E13,joey,On...?,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,On how far along he's in the sex change process!,8.2
S09E13,monica,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,",8.2
S09E13,joey,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,8.2
S09E13,joey,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Wow! Talking about high maintenance,8.2
S09E13,joey,Hey hey! You dye your hair!,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,I'm a woman!,8.2
S09E13,joey,Arghhh! Double standards!,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?",8.2
S09E13,monica,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out",8.2
S09E13,monica,"It's just, I'm not good at singing.",8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?,8.2
S09E13,monica,"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",8.2
S09E13,phoebe,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.,8.2
S09E13,monica,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,While drinking...,8.2
S09E13,monica,I'm there!,8.2
S09E13,rachel,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there,8.2
S09E13,rachel,No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Oh my god.,8.2
S09E13,monica,You kissed him?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...",8.2
S09E13,monica,Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",8.2
S09E13,monica,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",8.2
S09E13,monica,I thought you hated him?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",8.2
S09E13,monica,So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't",8.2
S09E13,monica,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross",8.2
S09E13,rachel,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",8.2
S09E13,joey,Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.,8.2
S09E13,joey,Chandler Bing.,8.2

S09E13,chandler,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?,8.2
S09E13,ross,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.,8.2
S09E13,chandler,"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,",8.2
S09E13,ross,That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?,8.2
S09E13,chandler,What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!,8.2
S09E13,ross,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me,8.2
S09E13,chandler,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing",8.2
S09E13,ross,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.",8.2
S09E13,chandler,Did she go out with him?,8.2
S09E13,ross,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",8.2
S09E13,chandler,Ah! The high road...,8.2
S09E13,ross,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!,8.2
S09E13,chandler,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?,8.2
S09E13,ross,"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the",8.2
S09E13,chandler,I thought I had to make the jokes!,8.2
S09E13,ross,Don't you have to be at work?,8.2
S09E13,chandler,"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.",8.2
S09E13,chandler,We still got it!,8.2
S09E13,rachel,Who is it?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,Why?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin",8.2
S09E13,rachel,"I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick",8.2
S09E13,rachel,Oh no no no,8.2
S09E13,rachel,So did I,8.2
S09E13,rachel,It's just a cold,8.2
S09E13,rachel,What? What's the matter?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.",8.2
S09E13,rachel,I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!,8.2
S09E13,rachel,Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"Right, right, yes!",8.2
S09E13,rachel,What?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,OK.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,I thought it was Ross.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,There isn't. There is totally isn't.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in",8.2
S09E13,rachel,Yes,8.2
S09E13,rachel,People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin,8.2
S09E13,rachel,So seriously...rodeo clown?,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,\No time for losers,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.,8.2
S09E13,monica,No I told you I can't.,8.2

S09E13,monica,"\Delta Dawn\""",8.2
S09E13,ross,"Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace",8.2
S09E13,ross,"Right, so that's a firm \no\"". I cannot believe this",8.2
S09E13,chandler,"I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed",8.2
S09E13,ross,This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.,8.2
S09E13,chandler,By drowning or...?!,8.2
S09E13,chandler,Well...,8.2
S09E13,ross,I know!,8.2
S09E13,monica,Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.,8.2
S09E13,phoebe,"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone",8.2
S09E13,monica,"Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing \Delta Dawn\""",8.2

S09E13,joey,"You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one",8.2

S09E13,chandler,"Ok. First of all, this is green!",8.2

S09E13,monica,Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.,8.2

S09E13,ross,What?,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?",8.2

S09E13,rachel,Ross?,8.2
S09E13,ross,I never gave it to you.,8.2
S09E13,rachel,Why?,8.2

S09E13,ross,None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one,8.2
S09E13,rachel,"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they",8.2

S09E14,joey,Why are they doing this?,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,8.2
S09E14,joey,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,8.2
S09E14,joey,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,8.2
S09E14,joey,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",8.2
S09E14,joey,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Ooh, that's a great plan!",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my \plan-laugh.\""",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",8.2
S09E14,rachel,Hey!,8.2
S09E14,monica,Hey!,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.",8.2
S09E14,monica,Oh my god.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,Wow.,8.2
S09E14,rachel,Why? What's the big deal?,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",8.2
S09E14,rachel,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",8.2
S09E14,monica,You want a job? Turn off \Oprah,8.2
S09E14,rachel,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Oh, it's perfect.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Ooh, Joey.",8.2
S09E14,joey,Hey.,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,8.2
S09E14,joey,All right! Who is he?,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Oh, yeah.",8.2
S09E14,joey,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,A teacher?,8.2
S09E14,joey,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Oh my god, you're right!",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,Yeah.,8.2
S09E14,joey,She even reads for pleasure!,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,How do you even know a woman like that?,8.2
S09E14,joey,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,Joey.,8.2
S09E14,joey,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,So now what do we do?,8.2
S09E14,joey,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",8.2
S09E14,joey,Ooh...I hear that's bad.,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Ah, yes, The Plan!",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"No, I think we killed it.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",8.2
S09E14,monica,"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,I don't do that.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",8.2
S09E14,monica,Yeah.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,Today is the sixth.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"No, it's not.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Yes, it's also 2003.",8.2
S09E14,monica,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,8.2
S09E14,monica,Okay.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,Tough crib.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,8.2
S09E14,monica,Chandler!,8.2
S09E14,chandler,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,8.2
S09E14,ross,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",8.2
S09E14,ross,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",8.2
S09E14,ross,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",8.2
S09E14,ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",8.2
S09E14,ross,No!,8.2
S09E14,monica,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",8.2
S09E14,monica,"So, let's do this.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,I - I don't think I can.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,Because of Emma.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,Sorry.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",8.2
S09E14,monica,Canoodling?,8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Well, I can't say \hump\"" or \""screw\"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.""",8.2
S09E14,monica,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...",8.2
S09E14,chandler,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,8.2
S09E14,monica,I guess you're right.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",8.2
S09E14,monica,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,What?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,Really? What's that like?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,Really?,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,Hello?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Hey, Rach!",8.2
S09E14,rachel,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,He's not stoned.,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,Did he go out for a cigarette?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Yeah, four times.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"My dear, sweet Rach.",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.  Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",8.2
S09E14,monica,She's asleep. Chandler?,8.2
S09E14,monica,What are you doing?,8.2
S09E14,chandler,Emma was doing it!,8.2

S09E14,joey,Hello?,8.2
S09E14,joey,Emma? Hey! Hi!,8.2
S09E14,joey,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",8.2
S09E14,joey,"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",8.2
S09E14,ross,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",8.2
S09E14,ross,"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.",8.2
S09E14,ross,Just the crab cakes.,8.2
S09E14,ross,What's - what's going on?,8.2
S09E14,ross,What? You - you're making money off my misery?,8.2
S09E14,ross,"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.",8.2
S09E14,monica,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,I think we may have really done it this time.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,You may wanna get some more of those too.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,Where's Emma?,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",8.2
S09E14,chandler,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",8.2
S09E14,monica,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,Okay.,8.2
S09E14,monica,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,Don't touch my coat!,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",8.2

S09E14,rachel,"What? What do you mean, \there you are\""? Where was she?""",8.2
S09E14,monica,"Oh, we were playing \peek-a-boo.\"" She just � she loves it when I'm dramatic.""",8.2
S09E14,joey,Because you two were having sex!,8.2
S09E14,monica,"No, we weren't!",8.2
S09E14,joey,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,8.2
S09E14,chandler,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",8.2
S09E14,joey,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.,8.2
S09E14,chandler,"No, no, no.",8.2
S09E14,monica,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",8.2
S09E14,joey,"Hey, I gotta! Unless...",8.2

S09E14,joey,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,8.2

S09E14,joey,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",8.2
S09E14,chandler,Your family name is Tribbiani.,8.2

S09E14,rachel,Yeah.,8.2
S09E14,ross,"I did, too.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,Oh.,8.2
S09E14,ross,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",8.2
S09E14,ross,Why does everyone keep saying that?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",8.2
S09E14,ross,That bad?,8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",8.2
S09E14,ross,Female body inspector? What size is that?,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",8.2
S09E14,joey,Uh-huh.,8.2
S09E14,phoebe,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,8.2
S09E14,joey,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",8.2
S09E14,ross,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",8.2
S09E14,rachel,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",8.2
S09E14,ross,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",8.2
S09E14,joey,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",8.2
S09E14,phoebe,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",8.2

S09E15,chandler,"Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you.",8.3

S09E15,phoebe,That's great.,8.3
S09E15,chandler,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating",8.3

S09E15,chandler,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.",8.3
S09E15,joey,Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!,8.3
S09E15,monica,What are they?,8.3
S09E15,chandler,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,8.3
S09E15,joey,I give you $ 500 for them!,8.3
S09E15,chandler,What am I supposed to do with these?,8.3
S09E15,monica,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",8.3
S09E15,chandler,"Well, first of all, they're not called \sneakers\"" anymore. Apparently",8.3
S09E15,monica,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?",8.3
S09E15,chandler,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.",8.3
S09E15,joey,"Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?",8.3
S09E15,ross,"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!",8.3
S09E15,monica,You okay?!,8.3
S09E15,ross,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!",8.3

S09E15,monica,"Phoebe, that is awful!",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…",8.3
S09E15,monica,You're mother killed herself!,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,She was a drug dealer!,8.3
S09E15,ross,"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,Okay…,8.3
S09E15,monica,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",8.3

S09E15,monica,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,You were?,8.3

S09E15,monica,Wonderwoman!,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,Oh my god…,8.3

S09E15,ross,A superhuman thirst for knowledge.,8.3
S09E15,monica,That's it.,8.3
S09E15,ross,"Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works.",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Okay, I think we have a problem here.",8.3
S09E15,monica,What?,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.",8.3
S09E15,monica,Yeah?,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.",8.3
S09E15,monica,So?,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",8.3

S09E15,monica,Hey!,8.3
S09E15,chandler,Hey!,8.3
S09E15,monica,What are you doing?,8.3
S09E15,chandler,"Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…",8.3
S09E15,rachel,"Oh, anything yet?",8.3
S09E15,joey,Hey!,8.3
S09E15,joey,Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?,8.3
S09E15,monica,"No, that seems about right.",8.3
S09E15,joey,"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",8.3
S09E15,rachel,"Joey, that was formula.",8.3
S09E15,joey,We gotta get more of that.,8.3
S09E15,chandler,You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.,8.3

S09E15,ross,"Oh…  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…",8.3
S09E15,ross,Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",8.3
S09E15,ross,"No, it wasn't.",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Yes, it was.",8.3
S09E15,ross,"No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,\Gimme your money,8.3
S09E15,ross,"Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me?",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one!",8.3
S09E15,ross,It's not the best!,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…",8.3

S09E15,ross,"Hey, let's not do this!",8.3
S09E15,chandler,Okay…  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…,8.3
S09E15,chandler,"Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me",8.3
S09E15,chandler,"I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",8.3
S09E15,chandler,The cold weather hurts my hip!,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?",8.3
S09E15,ross,"Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.,8.3
S09E15,ross,NA,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke.",8.3
S09E15,ross,Oh my god.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?,8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.",8.3
S09E15,ross,"You really thought \Science Boy\"" was worth saving!""",8.3

S09E15,ross,"Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.",8.3
S09E15,phoebe,"You're welcome. And thank you for \Science Boy\"". I learned a lot from him""",8.3
S09E15,ross,You're welcome.,8.3

S09E15,joey,"\I need an answer now!\""",8.3
S09E15,joey,Oh!,8.3
S09E15,joey,\You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you,8.3
S09E15,joey,"Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…",8.3
S09E15,monica,"Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!",8.3
S09E15,ross,"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that…",8.3
S09E15,monica,… that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.,8.3
S09E15,ross,I see. You didn't happen to tell…,8.3
S09E15,monica,… everybody we know? Yeah.,8.3
S09E15,ross,Great. Thanks!,8.3
S09E16,chandler,Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,8.2
S09E16,monica,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,8.2
S09E16,chandler,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",8.2
S09E16,monica,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",8.2
S09E16,chandler,Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,8.2
S09E16,monica,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",8.2
S09E16,chandler,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,8.2
S09E16,monica,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,8.2
S09E16,chandler,No! We're not borrowing money.,8.2
S09E16,monica,Why not?,8.2
S09E16,chandler,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,8.2
S09E16,monica,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,8.2
S09E16,chandler,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Why??,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,I want you to stay.,8.2

S09E16,phoebe,"I've always wanted to live with a guy. \Pick up your socks!\"" \""Put down the toilet seat!\"" \""No! We're not having sex anymore!\"" It's gonna be fun!""",8.2
S09E16,monica,Hey Joey!,8.2
S09E16,joey,Hey!,8.2
S09E16,monica,"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.",8.2
S09E16,joey,"I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.",8.2
S09E16,monica,Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,8.2
S09E16,joey,"Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.",8.2
S09E16,monica,But Chandler lent you money!,8.2
S09E16,joey,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.,8.2
S09E16,monica,Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.,8.2

S09E16,joey,"Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. \Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\"" or er.. \""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\"" Huh!""",8.2
S09E16,monica,"Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",8.2
S09E16,rachel,No. I was just going to do this myself.,8.2
S09E16,joey,You're gonna do it?,8.2
S09E16,rachel,"Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?",8.2
S09E16,joey,"Oh, women can. You can't.",8.2
S09E16,rachel,Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?,8.2
S09E16,monica,You're a pig. And you can't do this.,8.2
S09E16,rachel,Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!,8.2
S09E16,joey,The hardware store is right down the street.,8.2

S09E16,phoebe,I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.,8.2
S09E16,monica,"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing \This is what my sister would look like\""",8.2
S09E16,chandler,Yeah.... she's not so cute.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,"Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",8.2

S09E16,monica,I hear wedding bells.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,"Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah.

But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.",8.2
S09E16,ross,"Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.",8.2

S09E16,joey,Hey!,8.2
S09E16,chandler,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.,8.2
S09E16,joey,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.,8.2
S09E16,chandler,And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.,8.2
S09E16,joey,"Yeah, I know.",8.2
S09E16,chandler,What? What do you mean you know?,8.2
S09E16,joey,"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.",8.2

S09E16,joey,Something personal.,8.2
S09E16,chandler,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?,8.2
S09E16,joey,Boob job.,8.2
S09E16,monica,I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!,8.2
S09E16,joey,"Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,What do you mean?,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Oh. Wow.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Was it really that bad?,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,But it's just...,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Oh!,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!,8.2

S09E16,rachel,No you really think that's what it is?,8.2
S09E16,monica,"You heard him! \No bigger!\"" \""You're perfect!\"" \""Just don't get any bigger!\"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.""",8.2

S09E16,monica,I thought I was something that we both wanted!,8.2
S09E16,chandler,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",8.2

S09E16,phoebe,"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",8.2
S09E16,ross,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,What do you mean?,8.2
S09E16,ross,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,They are awfully boxy...,8.2
S09E16,ross,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Uh huh.,8.2
S09E16,ross,"Hey hey, can I help?",8.2
S09E16,chandler,"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",8.2
S09E16,ross,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.,8.2
S09E16,joey,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",8.2
S09E16,rachel,"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",8.2

S09E16,joey,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Someday.,8.2
S09E16,chandler,Aaaaand....... hernia.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Are you gonna change yours?,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,I don't want it to end either.,8.2
S09E16,phoebe,Yeah.,8.2

S09E17,chandler,What are you doin'?,8.5
S09E17,ross,"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .",8.5
S09E17,ross,It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?,8.5
S09E17,chandler,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?,8.5
S09E17,ross,"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...",8.5
S09E17,chandler,Bet she'd sleep with you now...,8.5
S09E17,ross,No... I already e-mailed her.,8.5
S09E17,ross,"You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.",8.5
S09E17,joey,Hey!,8.5
S09E17,ross,NA,8.5

S09E17,ross,I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!,8.5
S09E17,joey,NA,8.5
S09E17,rachel,Hey! How was basketball?,8.5
S09E17,joey,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oh, no! Who did that?",8.5
S09E17,joey,Chandler... hey...,8.5
S09E17,rachel,"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?",8.5
S09E17,joey,"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!",8.5
S09E17,joey,"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",8.5
S09E17,joey,Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Hi.,8.5
S09E17,monica,Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Oh, I'm so sorry!",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",8.5
S09E17,chandler,You're not gonna need my help?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",8.5
S09E17,monica,"Ok, you got it!",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",8.5
S09E17,monica,Really? If that's what you want...,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,That was a test and you just failed.,8.5
S09E17,monica,Damn it! Rookie mistake!,8.5
S09E17,ross,I have sex with dinosaurs??,8.5
S09E17,chandler,I believe I read that somewhere!,8.5
S09E17,ross,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!",8.5
S09E17,chandler,I respectfully disagree.,8.5
S09E17,ross,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,8.5
S09E17,chandler,Who cares? Nobody reads those things,8.5
S09E17,ross,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,8.5
S09E17,chandler,I don't have a page.,8.5
S09E17,ross,Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,8.5
S09E17,joey,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",8.5
S09E17,joey,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,What are you doing?,8.5
S09E17,joey,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",8.5
S09E17,joey,This isn't over.,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  \gay as the day is long\""?""",8.5
S09E17,chandler,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,8.5
S09E17,monica,But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.,8.5
S09E17,chandler,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! .",8.5
S09E17,monica,What are you doing?,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Oh, you'll see my friend.",8.5
S09E17,ross,I'm dead?,8.5
S09E17,chandler,And so young.,8.5
S09E17,ross,Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Well, how you died was funny.",8.5
S09E17,ross,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",8.5
S09E17,chandler,It kills over one americans every year.,8.5
S09E17,ross,"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,8.5
S09E17,ross,"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"God, I wish Mike were here.",8.5
S09E17,monica,Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,8.5
S09E17,monica,"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",8.5
S09E17,monica,"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Here.,8.5
S09E17,monica,And now your cell.,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Okay,8.5
S09E17,monica,This is your cellphone?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Yes.,8.5
S09E17,monica,This is your current cellphone?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",8.5
S09E17,monica,"Phoebe, where's your purse?",8.5
S09E17,monica,"No, no! Give it to me!",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,You can't have it.,8.5
S09E17,monica,Give it to me!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,No,8.5
S09E17,monica,I'll go in there.,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Oh yeah.,8.5
S09E17,monica,Phoebe come here,8.5
S09E17,monica,Haha!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,8.5
S09E17,joey,"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",8.5
S09E17,joey,"No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",8.5
S09E17,joey,"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",8.5
S09E17,joey,Make the transfer!,8.5
S09E17,rachel,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,8.5
S09E17,joey,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",8.5
S09E17,joey,But he's the same.,8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",8.5
S09E17,joey,But he's the same.,8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Joey, come on!",8.5
S09E17,joey,He's the same!,8.5
S09E17,joey,You're not the same!,8.5
S09E17,monica,Haha!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",8.5
S09E17,monica,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Those are my shoes.,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",8.5
S09E17,monica,Who's that?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,I ordered Chinese food.,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,8.5
S09E17,monica,What are you doing here?,8.5
S09E17,monica,Phoebe!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",8.5
S09E17,monica,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,8.5
S09E17,monica,Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,8.5
S09E17,monica,This doesn't concern you!!,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend .",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Sit down.,8.5
S09E17,monica,Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!,8.5
S09E17,monica,I've been pretty good!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Thanks, you look good too.",8.5
S09E17,monica,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,So how's the piano playing going?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,I've missed you too.,8.5
S09E17,monica,"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",8.5
S09E17,ross,"uhu uhu, check this out.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,8.5
S09E17,ross,"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little \Ross is dead\"" joke didn't work",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"No, come on, you know that's not true.",8.5
S09E17,ross,What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",8.5
S09E17,ross,I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",8.5
S09E17,ross,You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",8.5
S09E17,ross,Exactly!!,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?",8.5
S09E17,ross,No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",8.5
S09E17,ross,"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",8.5
S09E17,joey,Original or crappy?,8.5
S09E17,rachel,Original.,8.5
S09E17,joey,"No, sorry haven't seen him.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,Then what's that big lump under your covers?,8.5
S09E17,joey,"It's Monica, ok?",8.5
S09E17,rachel,That's not Monica!,8.5
S09E17,joey,"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",8.5
S09E17,rachel,Oh God.,8.5
S09E17,joey,... she's being unreasonable!,8.5
S09E17,rachel,It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!,8.5
S09E17,joey,It does?,8.5
S09E17,rachel,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,8.5
S09E17,joey,Really? She... she loves me?,8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .",8.5
S09E17,joey,"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.",8.5
S09E17,rachel,"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who's baaack!",8.5
S09E17,joey,Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.,8.5
S09E17,rachel,Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,8.5
S09E17,joey,How do you think I got him in the first place?,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",8.5
S09E17,monica,"Kiss him, you fool!!",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,What?,8.5
S09E17,monica,Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,8.5
S09E17,phoebe,"Oh, I missed you so much!",8.5
S09E17,phoebe,Who is this?,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!",8.5
S09E17,monica,Excuse me?,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",8.5
S09E17,monica,You didn't hear the speech!,8.5
S09E17,monica,"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!",8.5
S09E17,monica,You're... weird!,8.5
S09E17,monica,Oh !,8.5
S09E17,monica,Damn it!,8.5
S09E17,monica,And I blame you too.,8.5
S09E17,ross,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!",8.5
S09E17,chandler,There you go! Someone came!,8.5
S09E17,ross,"Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!",8.5
S09E17,monica,"Hi, glad you could come.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Please, come in.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps,8.5
S09E17,ross,Who is he?,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Some guy, Tom Gordon.",8.5
S09E17,ross,"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.",8.5
S09E17,monica,"So, did you know Ross well?",8.5
S09E17,monica,"Yes, he is. Me.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,NA,8.5
S09E17,chandler,Ok!,8.5
S09E17,ross,I'm dead and no one cares?,8.5
S09E17,monica,I look like a man??,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",8.5
S09E17,ross,"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",8.5
S09E17,ross,"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",8.5
S09E17,ross,Yeah...,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.",8.5
S09E17,chandler,Kori? Kori Weston?,8.5
S09E17,chandler,Wow! You look amazing!,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.",8.5
S09E17,monica,You are married though.,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!",8.5
S09E17,chandler,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,8.5
S09E17,chandler,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",8.5
S09E17,ross,"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",8.5
S09E17,ross,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,8.5
S09E17,ross,Monica?,8.5
S09E18,joey,"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",8.6

S09E18,monica,"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",8.6
S09E18,joey,Uh!,8.6
S09E18,monica,"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",8.6
S09E18,phoebe,Hey will you get me tickets too?,8.6
S09E18,rachel,"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!",8.6
S09E18,ross,No thanks!,8.6
S09E18,phoebe,You don't wanna win the lottery?,8.6
S09E18,ross,"Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",8.6
S09E18,chandler,Still on Amelia Earhart?,8.6
S09E18,ross,The woman just vanished!,8.6
S09E18,joey,"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",8.6
S09E18,ross,No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.,8.6
S09E18,chandler,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,8.6
S09E18,joey,I like those odds!,8.6
S09E18,ross,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",8.6
S09E18,chandler,Boohaki?,8.6
S09E18,ross,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.",8.6
S09E18,rachel,"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",8.6

S09E18,chandler,Kinda like Joey.,8.6
S09E18,joey,What's that now?,8.6
S09E18,monica,God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,8.6
S09E18,chandler,Pie eating contest?,8.6
S09E18,monica,Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",8.6
S09E18,monica,That was a good day!,8.6
S09E18,ross,"They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!",8.6
S09E18,monica,I'm parked in a garage on Morton!,8.6
S09E18,ross,They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.,8.6

S09E18,rachel,She dropped off a casserole?,8.6
S09E18,joey,Oh yeah! The casserole lady.,8.6
S09E18,monica,"So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",8.6
S09E18,ross,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",8.6
S09E18,chandler,NA,8.6
S09E18,ross,Think he washed his hands?,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",8.6

S09E18,joey,Ooh! Tough odds!,8.6
S09E18,ross,Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!,8.6
S09E18,joey,Look who's coming around!,8.6
S09E18,chandler,Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.,8.6
S09E18,joey,Did you get it?,8.6
S09E18,chandler,One of the slots got filled.,8.6

S09E18,monica,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",8.6
S09E18,ross,A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!,8.6
S09E18,monica,"Alright, who wants to do it?",8.6
S09E18,phoebe,"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",8.6
S09E18,monica,"Ok, hey Rach?",8.6
S09E18,rachel,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",8.6
S09E18,joey,I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,8.6
S09E18,phoebe,I hope I win!,8.6
S09E18,monica,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",8.6
S09E18,joey,I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!,8.6
S09E18,monica,"Right! .. but we \know\"" what you're wishing for!""",8.6
S09E18,joey,Can't really say!,8.6
S09E18,monica,"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",8.6
S09E18,joey,I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,8.6
S09E18,phoebe,"One, two, three!",8.6
S09E18,joey,"I won, hey!",8.6
S09E18,ross,"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!",8.6
S09E18,rachel,"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",8.6
S09E18,ross,"Uh, you're not gonna win.",8.6
S09E18,rachel,"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like \oh everybody",8.6
S09E18,ross,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",8.6
S09E18,ross,Why would I eat my own arm?,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",8.6
S09E18,monica,"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",8.6
S09E18,ross,Why?,8.6
S09E18,monica,"Because I know that you think the lottery is \boohaki\"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother",8.6
S09E18,ross,"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here",8.6
S09E18,phoebe,Get a room!,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",8.6
S09E18,ross,"I don't know, probably just invest it.",8.6
S09E18,chandler,Ooh! Calm down ...,8.6
S09E18,joey,"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",8.6
S09E18,ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say \invest it\""? I meant \""be cool and piss it all away\""",8.6
S09E18,joey,"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",8.6
S09E18,rachel,I don't really care about the Knicks.,8.6
S09E18,joey,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",8.6
S09E18,rachel,You would do that? I never get picked!,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",8.6
S09E18,joey,You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",8.6
S09E18,ross,"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",8.6
S09E18,chandler,Uh ... Mommy?,8.6
S09E18,ross,"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \Mommy\"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...""",8.6
S09E18,rachel,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,8.6
S09E18,ross,"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me \Daddy\"" too.""",8.6
S09E18,phoebe,"Oooh, I like that, \daddy\""",8.6
S09E18,ross,I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,8.6
S09E18,phoebe,"Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",8.6
S09E18,ross,no I can't.,8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.",8.6
S09E18,joey,"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",8.6
S09E18,monica,"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",8.6

S09E18,monica,"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",8.6
S09E18,ross,3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...,8.6

S09E18,chandler,"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",8.6

S09E18,phoebe,"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together",8.6
S09E18,monica,"No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",8.6
S09E18,joey,"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!",8.6
S09E18,chandler,"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",8.6

S09E19,rachel,Olivia.,8.1
S09E19,monica,"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.",8.1
S09E19,rachel,So do you think that my dream means anything?,8.1
S09E19,monica,"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",8.1
S09E19,rachel,Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,8.1
S09E19,monica,"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",8.1
S09E19,rachel,You took the same class twice.,8.1
S09E19,monica,It was hard!,8.1

S09E19,phoebe,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",8.1
S09E19,monica,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",8.1
S09E19,phoebe,"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .",8.1
S09E19,rachel,"Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",8.1

S09E19,rachel,"Ok, we're still on that.",8.1
S09E19,monica,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,8.1
S09E19,phoebe,Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,8.1
S09E19,monica,Tiny portions?,8.1
S09E19,phoebe,"Yeah well, \excuse me",8.1
S09E19,monica,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",8.1
S09E19,phoebe,Well...it's not about quality.,8.1
S09E19,monica,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",8.1
S09E19,phoebe,"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",8.1
S09E19,monica,"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",8.1
S09E19,phoebe,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",8.1
S09E19,monica,"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",8.1

S09E19,monica,Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?,8.1
S09E19,phoebe,"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .",8.1
S09E19,monica,Excuse us!,8.1

S09E19,phoebe,I'm sorry too...,8.1
S09E19,monica,ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,8.1

S09E19,joey,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...",8.1
S09E19,rachel,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?",8.1
S09E19,joey,"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",8.1
S09E19,rachel,So?,8.1
S09E19,joey,So...I've never played that!,8.1
S09E19,rachel,"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",8.1
S09E19,joey,Uh...well...just once...with you...,8.1
S09E19,rachel,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?,8.1
S09E19,joey,What the hell are you talking about??,8.1
S09E19,rachel,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.",8.1
S09E19,joey,"Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.",8.1
S09E19,rachel,"Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...",8.1
S09E19,joey,"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.",8.1

S09E20,monica,It sounds interesting!,8.2
S09E20,ross,"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...",8.2
S09E20,phoebe,"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?",8.2
S09E20,joey,"You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!",8.2

S09E20,ross,"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.",8.2
S09E20,phoebe,"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.",8.2
S09E20,ross,"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.",8.2
S09E20,phoebe,"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...",8.2

S09E21,monica,"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",8.2
S09E21,rachel,I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.,8.2
S09E21,ross,"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!",8.2

S09E21,rachel,"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",8.2
S09E21,rachel,I don't care about any of that!!,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Well, do you care about friendship?",8.2

S09E21,chandler,We really need to take those tests?,8.2
S09E21,monica,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",8.2

S09E21,monica,What is the big deal?,8.2
S09E21,chandler,It's weird! In a doctor's office?,8.2
S09E21,monica,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?,8.2

S09E21,ross,"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",8.2
S09E21,joey,"You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!",8.2
S09E21,joey,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.",8.2
S09E21,joey,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",8.2
S09E21,ross,But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...,8.2

S09E21,chandler,"No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??",8.2
S09E21,chandler,What!?,8.2
S09E21,monica,This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!,8.2
S09E21,chandler,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...",8.2
S09E21,chandler,NA,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Hello \ja\""",8.2
S09E21,rachel,"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Okay, then I'm Swedish...",8.2
S09E21,monica,"So, what's your name?",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...,8.2
S09E21,rachel,Oh... what an interesting name.,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Ja!,8.2
S09E21,rachel,You know I...,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Time for your scalp massage!,8.2
S09E21,rachel,NA,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Is something wrong?,8.2
S09E21,rachel,"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Uhm... Stockholm.,8.2
S09E21,rachel,Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,8.2
S09E21,joey,Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.,8.2
S09E21,ross,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",8.2
S09E21,joey,"No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",8.2
S09E21,joey,Phonetically?,8.2
S09E21,ross,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",8.2
S09E21,joey,Ok.,8.2
S09E21,ross,"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",8.2
S09E21,joey,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \Days\"" I had to say \""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\"".""",8.2
S09E21,ross,Wow. What does that mean?,8.2
S09E21,joey,"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means \you're gonna get eaten by a bear\"".""",8.2
S09E21,ross,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,8.2
S09E21,joey,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",8.2
S09E21,joey,Come on! you...,8.2
S09E21,ross,No!,8.2

S09E21,chandler,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!,8.2
S09E21,chandler,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,8.2
S09E21,chandler,"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",8.2
S09E21,chandler,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",8.2
S09E21,chandler,"It was a \Wendy's!! \""",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,NA,8.2
S09E21,rachel,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Oh, Ja! Ja!",8.2
S09E21,rachel,Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",8.2
S09E21,rachel,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!,8.2
S09E21,rachel,Phoebe!!,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,You know it's me?,8.2
S09E21,rachel,"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,How can you come here?,8.2
S09E21,rachel,How could you not tell me you worked here?,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,I don't have to tell you everything!,8.2
S09E21,rachel,"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Tips not included.,8.2
S09E21,rachel,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",8.2
S09E21,rachel,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",8.2
S09E21,phoebe,You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!,8.2
S09E21,rachel,Good for you Pheebs!,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,Ok.,8.2
S09E21,phoebe,"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.",8.2

S09E21,ross,Hey!,8.2
S09E21,ross,"Hey, how was the Met?",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",8.2
S09E21,ross,What do you mean?,8.2
S09E21,ross,"Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.",8.2
S09E21,ross,What?,8.2
S09E21,ross,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",8.2
S09E21,ross,"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",8.2
S09E21,ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",8.2
S09E21,ross,That was going to be my next argument.,8.2
S09E21,joey,Hey!,8.2
S09E21,ross,Hey!,8.2
S09E21,joey,You're ready?,8.2
S09E21,joey,"Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.",8.2
S09E21,ross,Glad I could help man.,8.2
S09E21,joey,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but...  I made it work.",8.2
S09E21,chandler,It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.,8.2
S09E21,chandler,"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.",8.2

S09E21,chandler,Doctor Connelly just called.,8.2
S09E21,monica,"With good news?  \Doctor Connelly just called! \"" But so what is it? Is there a problem",8.2
S09E21,chandler,Actually it's both of us.,8.2
S09E21,monica,What?,8.2
S09E21,chandler,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,8.2
S09E21,monica,Oh... what does that mean?,8.2
S09E21,chandler,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...,8.2
S09E21,monica,Chandler?,8.2
S09E21,chandler,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",8.2
S09E21,monica,Oh my God!,8.2
S09E21,chandler,I'm sorry.,8.2
S09E21,monica,I'm sorry too.,8.2

S09E22,rachel,"Yeah, yeah... It's... \climax your way to better skin\"".""",7.8
S09E22,joey,"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",7.8
S09E22,joey,Oh hey Rach!,7.8
S09E22,rachel,Yeah...,7.8
S09E22,joey,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Oh, well...",7.8
S09E22,joey,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",7.8

S09E22,phoebe,"Ok, that'll be great!",7.8
S09E22,joey,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",7.8
S09E22,rachel,That's not what we're gonna do!,7.8
S09E22,joey,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",7.8
S09E22,chandler,Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!,7.8
S09E22,monica,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",7.8
S09E22,chandler,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",7.8
S09E22,chandler,Hi.,7.8
S09E22,monica,Hi.,7.8
S09E22,monica,Ok.,7.8

S09E22,ross,"Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?",7.8
S09E22,joey,"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!",7.8
S09E22,ross,"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",7.8
S09E22,ross,"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",7.8

S09E22,ross,Tsz... NO! .,7.8
S09E22,chandler,Hey guys!,7.8

S09E22,chandler,"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",7.8
S09E22,ross,It's in Barbados.,7.8
S09E22,chandler,But you come first!,7.8
S09E22,rachel,I'm there!,7.8

S09E22,chandler,Ok.,7.8
S09E22,joey,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",7.8
S09E22,chandler,Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.,7.8
S09E22,ross,So-so what did the doctor say?,7.8
S09E22,chandler,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",7.8
S09E22,joey,So you're ruling out surrogacy?,7.8
S09E22,chandler,Yeah.,7.8
S09E22,joey,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?",7.8
S09E22,chandler,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",7.8
S09E22,joey,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",7.8
S09E22,chandler,ah-ha!,7.8
S09E22,ross,How do you feel about all this?,7.8
S09E22,chandler,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,7.8
S09E22,joey,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",7.8
S09E22,ross,What?,7.8
S09E22,ross,What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!,7.8
S09E22,ross,The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,7.8
S09E22,ross,"is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",7.8
S09E22,ross,"Oh, that's not what you want...",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"Oh, I'll take some of that.",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Pheebs, that's for men!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah.",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"On Melanie Griffith in \Working girl\"". I think what you want is over here.""",7.8
S09E22,rachel,Really?,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",7.8

S09E22,phoebe,"Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",7.8
S09E22,rachel,Sure!,7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Ok!,7.8
S09E22,rachel,You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Why?,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Who else?,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,You like Joey?,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Oh my God!,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Oh, I get it!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Yeah.,7.8
S09E22,rachel,So can we keep this between us?,7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Sure!,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Oh.,7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,7.8
S09E22,monica,Hi honey!,7.8
S09E22,chandler,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",7.8
S09E22,monica,"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",7.8
S09E22,chandler,"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",7.8
S09E22,monica,I got it.,7.8
S09E22,chandler,"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",7.8
S09E22,monica,"Yeah, I guess.",7.8
S09E22,chandler,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",7.8
S09E22,monica,Excuse me?,7.8
S09E22,chandler,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is \spermtastic\""!""",7.8
S09E22,monica,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! \Come up",7.8
S09E22,chandler,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",7.8
S09E22,monica,Chandler!,7.8
S09E22,chandler,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",7.8
S09E22,monica,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,7.8
S09E22,chandler,Ok!,7.8
S09E22,monica,Uh!,7.8
S09E22,chandler,Zack!,7.8
S09E22,monica,"Tell me about yourself, Zack!",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Ok, great!",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,I didn't say anything yet!,7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Well, get back in there and talk!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,7.8
S09E22,rachel,What!?,7.8
S09E22,phoebe,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",7.8
S09E22,rachel,"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",7.8
S09E22,phoebe,Ooh! We have a problem.,7.8
S09E22,rachel,Oh! What are we gonna do?,7.8

S09E22,joey,"Well, just wake him up!",7.8
S09E22,ross,"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",7.8
S09E22,joey,"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",7.8
S09E22,monica,Hey guys! Dinner's ready!,7.8

S09E22,chandler,Alright! Just follow my lead!,7.8
S09E22,chandler,"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",7.8

S09E23,phoebe,"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",8.5
S09E23,phoebe,"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.",8.5
S09E23,phoebe,"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.",8.5

S09E23,rachel,Nooo!,8.5
S09E23,monica,Damn it!,8.5
S09E23,ross,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!",8.5
S09E23,ross,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.,8.5
S09E23,rachel,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",8.5
S09E23,chandler,Not to mention the cold sores.,8.5
S09E23,ross,"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",8.5
S09E23,chandler,Really?,8.5
S09E23,ross,"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...",8.5
S09E23,joey,"He said \erectus\""!""",8.5
S09E23,joey,"No, he really said it.",8.5

S09E23,chandler,I don't think so!,8.5
S09E23,monica,Why not?,8.5
S09E23,chandler,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!",8.5
S09E23,monica,I'm not always that bad!,8.5
S09E23,chandler,"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",8.5

S10E01,monica,"Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.",8.5

S10E01,rachel,"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?,8.5
S10E01,joey,"Well, he's with Charlie now.",8.5
S10E01,monica,"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?",8.5
S10E01,joey,"You're a pain in my ass, Geller!",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...",8.5
S10E01,chandler,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?",8.5
S10E01,rachel,Sure...,8.5
S10E01,chandler,Enunciate!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Get out!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Are they right?,8.5
S10E01,joey,"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.",8.5
S10E01,joey,"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...",8.5
S10E01,rachel,Although...,8.5
S10E01,joey,I like although!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...",8.5
S10E01,joey,Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.",8.5
S10E01,joey,Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.,8.5
S10E01,rachel,No...,8.5
S10E01,joey,I'm thinking about you...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Yeah...,8.5
S10E01,joey,Let's forget about Ross...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Forgotten.,8.5
S10E01,joey,What's wrong?,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Nothing...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...",8.5
S10E01,joey,"Well, maybe I can help.",8.5
S10E01,joey,Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...,8.5
S10E01,ross,Hey!,8.5

S10E01,ross,Dude! You're not taking your Bible?,8.5
S10E01,chandler,"You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?",8.5
S10E01,ross,Learn about Jesus...,8.5
S10E01,ross,Hey!,8.5
S10E01,ross,"Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.",8.5
S10E01,ross,Stop it!,8.5
S10E01,ross,You're filthy!,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Hey, have you guys seen Monica?",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...",8.5
S10E01,monica,Check it out!,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!,8.5
S10E01,chandler,Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!,8.5
S10E01,monica,What do you think?,8.5

S10E01,monica,Don't you just love it?,8.5
S10E01,ross,Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.,8.5
S10E01,ross,"You've never said that in your life, have you?",8.5
S10E01,ross,I thought so.,8.5
S10E01,monica,And listen to this...,8.5
S10E01,chandler,What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.,8.5
S10E01,joey,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.",8.5
S10E01,chandler,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.",8.5
S10E01,joey,"Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.",8.5
S10E01,joey,I understand...,8.5
S10E01,ross,"No, I'll do it.",8.5
S10E01,chandler,Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,Aaah... you're not good at this...,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,What?,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,Why not?,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,You have a... You have a date? With who?,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,You have... have a girlfriend?,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,For how long?,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says \duty free\"".""",8.5
S10E01,rachel,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.,8.5
S10E01,joey,I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",8.5
S10E01,joey,Ooh...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Still nervous?,8.5
S10E01,joey,I'm gonna get the lasagna.,8.5
S10E01,ross,Hey Rach...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Yeah!,8.5
S10E01,ross,Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!",8.5
S10E01,ross,Hey!,8.5
S10E01,joey,Hey!,8.5
S10E01,ross,"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.",8.5
S10E01,joey,Yeah?,8.5
S10E01,ross,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...",8.5
S10E01,joey,You kissed.,8.5
S10E01,ross,Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?,8.5
S10E01,joey,I saw you.,8.5
S10E01,ross,"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.",8.5
S10E01,joey,"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.",8.5
S10E01,ross,What?,8.5
S10E01,joey,"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.",8.5
S10E01,ross,Are you serious?,8.5
S10E01,joey,Yeah... Now I have something...,8.5
S10E01,ross,"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?",8.5
S10E01,joey,Oh... uh... look... before you...,8.5
S10E01,ross,"No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...",8.5
S10E01,joey,"I am those things, yeah.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...",8.5
S10E01,joey,Dude!,8.5
S10E01,ross,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",8.5
S10E01,joey,I can't think of anything.,8.5
S10E01,ross,Thanks!,8.5
S10E01,joey,Yeah.,8.5
S10E01,rachel,So hi!,8.5
S10E01,ross,Hi!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"So you eh, you talked to Joey?",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,Oh! That's great!,8.5
S10E01,ross,Yeah!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Oh, so everything's okay?",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Well, I'm so excited about this.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,Really? Excited?,8.5
S10E01,ross,Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?",8.5
S10E01,joey,I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",8.5
S10E01,joey,"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Hi, Mike's place.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Ooh, that was fast.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,I... I'm Phoebe.,8.5
S10E01,phoebe,Enchanté,8.5
S10E01,monica,"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!",8.5
S10E01,chandler,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?",8.5
S10E01,monica,Yeah!,8.5
S10E01,chandler,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",8.5
S10E01,monica,"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this.",8.5
S10E01,chandler,What are you singing?,8.5
S10E01,monica,"It's \Bolero\"" from \""10\"".""",8.5
S10E01,monica,You what? You said you liked them.,8.5
S10E01,chandler,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.,8.5
S10E01,monica,"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",8.5
S10E01,chandler,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",8.5
S10E01,monica,"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH!",8.5
S10E01,chandler,Hit yourself in the tooth?,8.5
S10E01,monica,And the eye!,8.5
S10E01,ross,NA,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Okay, shoot!",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",8.5
S10E01,ross,OH NO!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,What? What is it?,8.5
S10E01,ross,"Oh, major shampoo explosion!",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?",8.5
S10E01,rachel,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?,8.5
S10E01,ross,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",8.5
S10E01,ross,"Duh, you think?",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Well, I don't...",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",8.5
S10E01,phoebe,You're welcome!,8.5
S10E01,chandler,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?",8.5
S10E01,monica,Not really.,8.5
S10E01,monica,I have a problem.,8.5
S10E01,chandler,Really? What happened?,8.5
S10E01,monica,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing \No Woman",8.5
S10E01,chandler,You can't move at all?,8.5
S10E01,monica,"Oh, well, I can move...",8.5
S10E01,chandler,"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",8.5
S10E01,monica,I guess so...,8.5
S10E01,chandler,Some of these look a little frayed.,8.5
S10E01,monica,"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",8.5
S10E01,joey,Hey!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Hi!,8.5
S10E01,joey,"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",8.5
S10E01,joey,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",8.5
S10E01,joey,"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...",8.5
S10E01,joey,"I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.",8.5
S10E01,rachel,"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",8.5
S10E01,joey,Yeah! Good night!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Goo--ood night!,8.5
S10E01,joey,Good night!,8.5
S10E01,rachel,"Seriously, good night!",8.5
S10E01,joey,Stop saying good night.,8.5
S10E01,rachel,Okay.,8.5
S10E01,monica,Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...,8.5
S10E01,chandler,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?",8.5
S10E01,monica,"Sure, what do you have in mind?",8.5
S10E01,chandler,I think you know.,8.5
S10E01,monica,Really? I don't really feel like it.,8.5
S10E01,chandler,This is what I want to do.,8.5
S10E01,monica,"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",8.5
S10E01,chandler,"She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.",8.5
S10E02,joey,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",8.8
S10E02,rachel,We weren't doing anything!,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Rach, he just saw us.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,Shhh.,8.8
S10E02,joey,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Yeah, but it did happen, so...",8.8
S10E02,joey,Ross?,8.8
S10E02,rachel,Ross?  Can we just close the door?,8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Ross, say something. Anything.",8.8
S10E02,ross,So you two are..?,8.8
S10E02,ross,And have you .. ed?,8.8
S10E02,joey,"No, no, no!",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"No, no, no!",8.8
S10E02,ross,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",8.8
S10E02,joey,Probably.,8.8
S10E02,joey,"No, no!",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.",8.8
S10E02,ross,I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?,8.8
S10E02,rachel,"No, but you know what I mean.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!",8.8
S10E02,joey,Really?,8.8
S10E02,ross,Absolutely.  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.,8.8
S10E02,joey,Ross..,8.8
S10E02,ross,"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?",8.8
S10E02,rachel,Calm ourselves?,8.8
S10E02,ross,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!",8.8
S10E02,joey,I do like fajitas.,8.8
S10E02,monica,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",8.8
S10E02,chandler,There's a hair in my coffee.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Hey guys!,8.8
S10E02,monica,Hey.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",8.8
S10E02,chandler,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say \triplets",8.8
S10E02,monica,That's sweet. Drink your hair.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Hey, what's all this stuff?",8.8
S10E02,monica,"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!",8.8
S10E02,monica,That's not really how it works.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Oh, how does it work?",8.8
S10E02,monica,I don't know!,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",8.8
S10E02,monica,"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Hey!,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Good to see you.,8.8
S10E02,monica,Hi Frank.,8.8
S10E02,monica,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!",8.8
S10E02,monica,Which one is which again?,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Well, what would we be doing?",8.8
S10E02,joey,"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",8.8
S10E02,rachel,Feel me up?,8.8
S10E02,joey,In a carriage!,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Hey, Charlie!",8.8
S10E02,rachel,Hey.,8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Oh, you bet.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Oh. Oh, thanks.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",8.8
S10E02,ross,"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Come, please come in. Come in.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",8.8
S10E02,ross,Oh! That is so thoughtful.,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Uh, actually, that's..",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!",8.8
S10E02,ross,What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",8.8
S10E02,ross,You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"That's a, that's a long time.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,What?,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?,8.8
S10E02,monica,Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.,8.8
S10E02,chandler,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?",8.8
S10E02,chandler,"I mean, you have a lovely home.",8.8
S10E02,monica,"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.",8.8
S10E02,monica,Oh my god!,8.8
S10E02,monica,Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.,8.8
S10E02,chandler,That's great.  Can I see the book?,8.8

S10E02,chandler,You know how to use a compass?,8.8
S10E02,chandler,You do? That's fantastic!,8.8
S10E02,chandler,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",8.8
S10E02,chandler,What?,8.8
S10E02,chandler,I got nothing.,8.8
S10E02,ross,"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?",8.8
S10E02,ross,"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,No awareness.,8.8
S10E02,ross,"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?",8.8
S10E02,ross,My fajitas!!,8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",8.8
S10E02,ross,That is gonna hurt tomorrow!,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Insane.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Alice would never go for it, right?",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Frank Jr.Jr.?,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Uh-huh.,8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?",8.8

S10E02,phoebe,"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",8.8
S10E02,phoebe,Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.,8.8
S10E02,chandler,Where are Bill and Colleen?,8.8
S10E02,monica,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?,8.8
S10E02,chandler,We have to leave!!,8.8
S10E02,monica,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,8.8
S10E02,chandler,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.",8.8
S10E02,monica,"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",8.8
S10E02,chandler,But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?,8.8
S10E02,chandler,See? Intuitive!,8.8
S10E02,chandler,Which technically now you should give back!,8.8
S10E02,chandler,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. \Owen doesn't know he's adopted",8.8
S10E02,ross,Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.,8.8
S10E02,rachel,Ooy.,8.8

S10E02,ross,O is for \oh,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Dude, are you okay?",8.8

S10E02,rachel,"Ross, you don't seem okay.",8.8
S10E02,ross,No!,8.8
S10E02,ross,Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.,8.8
S10E02,ross,Okay.,8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.",8.8
S10E02,rachel,"No, no, it's just that it's getting late...",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.",8.8
S10E02,ross,I don't even know what that's for.,8.8

S10E02,rachel,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",8.8
S10E02,joey,Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.,8.8
S10E02,rachel,"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"It doesn't look good, does it?",8.8
S10E02,joey,Morning. Here you go.,8.8
S10E02,ross,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?,8.8
S10E02,joey,Yeah.,8.8
S10E02,ross,So you took off my pants and shoes?,8.8
S10E02,joey,"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.",8.8
S10E02,ross,What do you mean?,8.8
S10E02,joey,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!",8.8
S10E02,joey,"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?",8.8
S10E02,joey,"That's what I hear, yeah.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...",8.8
S10E02,ross,Joey.,8.8
S10E02,joey,I'm crazy about her.,8.8
S10E02,ross,And she feels the same way?,8.8
S10E02,joey,I think so.,8.8
S10E02,ross,"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.",8.8
S10E02,joey,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.",8.8
S10E02,ross,"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?",8.8
S10E02,joey,"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?",8.8
S10E02,ross,"Yeah, I'm sure.",8.8
S10E02,joey,And we're okay?,8.8
S10E02,monica,"Hey, Phoebs",8.8

S10E02,phoebe,"Still, he had to find out sometime.",8.8

S10E03,ross,OH! SON OF A BITCH!,8.8
S10E03,rachel,What is the matter with us?,8.8
S10E03,joey,"Well, I know what's the matter with me.",8.8
S10E03,rachel,"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?",8.8
S10E03,joey,I don't know.,8.8
S10E03,chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!",8.8
S10E03,rachel,"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?",8.8
S10E03,chandler,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...",8.8
S10E03,rachel,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...",8.8
S10E03,joey,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?",8.8
S10E03,chandler,"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.",8.8
S10E03,chandler,"I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.",8.8
S10E03,rachel,"Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.",8.8
S10E03,joey,"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.",8.8
S10E03,rachel,"Right, totally.",8.8
S10E03,joey,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.",8.8
S10E03,rachel,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.",8.8
S10E03,joey,That's a... pla-an.,8.8
S10E03,joey,Wow... I did not see this coming.,8.8
S10E03,rachel,I know.,8.8
S10E03,joey,"I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.",8.8
S10E03,rachel,Hmmm... Me too...,8.8
S10E03,rachel,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?,8.8
S10E03,joey,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.,8.8
S10E03,rachel,Aah... I bet you're right.,8.8
S10E03,joey,So...,8.8
S10E03,rachel,Yeah.,8.8
S10E03,joey,I love ya.,8.8
S10E03,rachel,"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.",8.8
S10E03,joey,"Yeah, me too.",8.8
S10E03,joey,"Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.",8.8
S10E03,chandler,"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.",8.8
S10E03,ross,Go away! I don't want to see anybody.,8.8
S10E03,chandler,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.",8.8
S10E03,ross,Really? Did you count Mississipily?,8.8
S10E03,ross,"Dude, you're not tanned.",8.8
S10E03,chandler,"No, I just had to get a picture of this.",8.8
S10E03,chandler,I see you later!,8.8
S10E04,monica,Hey guys!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.",8.3
S10E04,monica,That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!",8.3
S10E04,ross,Yeah!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,We're having a party.,8.3
S10E04,monica,"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?",8.3
S10E04,ross,No.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!",8.3
S10E04,chandler,Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",8.3
S10E04,chandler,There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!",8.3
S10E04,monica,"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!",8.3
S10E04,ross,Hey guys!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",8.3
S10E04,ross,Yeah!,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",8.3
S10E04,ross,"That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Ah, and where is Joey?",8.3
S10E04,rachel,I said it's still nap time.,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Hey, there is uncle Joey!",8.3
S10E04,joey,Hey!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!",8.3
S10E04,joey,"18, uh?",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Joey, NO!",8.3
S10E04,joey,"What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",8.3
S10E04,ross,When they see this you'll be 52!,8.3
S10E04,joey,And starting to think about settling down!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?",8.3
S10E04,joey,I'd love to! Yeah!,8.3
S10E04,joey,We were supposed to bring presents?,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Joey, it's a birthday party.",8.3
S10E04,joey,"Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says \El-moo\""!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!""",8.3
S10E04,monica,Hey!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh, she's still napping",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.",8.3
S10E04,monica,All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",8.3
S10E04,ross,Hey!,8.3
S10E04,monica,So glad you came!,8.3
S10E04,ross,There's something you didn't know about your dad!,8.3
S10E04,joey,Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",8.3
S10E04,monica,I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,"I know, what are we gonna do?",8.3
S10E04,monica,I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,So you’re gonna... hit on her?,8.3
S10E04,joey,"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Oh!,8.3
S10E04,joey,"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Hey, I think Emma might like it!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,Oh! Emma might like what?,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Um, my present!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,What did you get her?,8.3
S10E04,joey,Actually we prepared performances.,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Separate performances.,8.3
S10E04,joey,But equally real!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Sure, yeah!",8.3
S10E04,joey,O K.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Oh, great!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?",8.3
S10E04,joey,I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh, ok, which one?",8.3
S10E04,joey,"Uh, why, it’s a... . And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,Wow! That was amazing!,8.3
S10E04,ross,Thank you so much for that gift!,8.3
S10E04,ross,Amazing... amazing.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,Is that it?,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading  Finding your G-spot.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.",8.3
S10E04,ross,Sure.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",8.3
S10E04,rachel,Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",8.3
S10E04,ross,I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!",8.3
S10E04,joey,I'm so confused!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",8.3
S10E04,chandler,To be fair this one does have nuts.,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!",8.3
S10E04,chandler,Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?,8.3
S10E04,monica,"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"And you know, I have a massage client soon.",8.3
S10E04,ross,"You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Alright, 5 more minutes.",8.3
S10E04,ross,NA,8.3
S10E04,chandler,Was that Emma? Is she up?,8.3
S10E04,ross,"No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.",8.3
S10E04,monica,No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?",8.3
S10E04,chandler,I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!",8.3
S10E04,joey,Got it!  Where do you think you're going?,8.3
S10E04,chandler,To the bathroom!,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,NA,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"No, it did not.",8.3
S10E04,joey,No.,8.3
S10E04,joey,Ok!,8.3
S10E04,joey,Nighty-night!,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Bye, bye.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Joey? How could you just let them leave?,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",8.3
S10E04,joey,NA,8.3
S10E04,chandler,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",8.3
S10E04,joey,Oh! I forgot you used to live here!,8.3
S10E04,joey,Hello?,8.3
S10E04,joey,Hey!,8.3
S10E04,joey,What audition?,8.3
S10E04,joey,What? You never said anything about an audition!,8.3
S10E04,joey,A monologue? I don't have..  Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!",8.3
S10E04,monica,No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Ok, ten.",8.3
S10E04,joey,"Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"No, lets just draw straws.",8.3
S10E04,joey,"Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",8.3
S10E04,chandler,I'm begging you stop.,8.3
S10E04,joey,Right.,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Yeah!! Let's do that!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!,8.3
S10E04,monica,Everybody get your toys!,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Ok! I want the dolphin!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,Thats a bear.,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,I'm too excited!,8.3
S10E04,monica,"Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!",8.3
S10E04,joey,"Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Go! Go!,8.3
S10E04,joey,Come on robot!,8.3
S10E04,monica,What are you barking at?,8.3
S10E04,monica,Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?,8.3
S10E04,chandler,I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?,8.3
S10E04,joey,Way to go robot!,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,Good job Alan!,8.3
S10E04,joey,"Hey, good race you guys.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Yeah, see you later!",8.3
S10E04,monica,"No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...",8.3
S10E04,chandler,They left.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,Bye...,8.3
S10E04,ross,RACHEL!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,OOH! God! Sorry!,8.3
S10E04,ross,I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,Emma's awake.,8.3
S10E04,ross,Yeah?,8.3
S10E04,rachel,I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Rach, she's not going to remember this.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,They have to learn!,8.3
S10E04,ross,Hey!,8.3
S10E04,rachel,What?,8.3
S10E04,ross,It's not bad.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Well, I'm very impressed.",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.",8.3
S10E04,monica,"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",8.3
S10E04,monica,Game?,8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.",8.3
S10E04,chandler,Ooh! That's my girl!,8.3
S10E04,monica,That's how old you are.,8.3
S10E04,chandler,Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?,8.3
S10E04,monica,"Ooh, I want one...",8.3
S10E04,chandler,Me too...,8.3
S10E04,chandler,There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?,8.3
S10E04,monica,...and head to Canada!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,I was kidding.,8.3
S10E04,monica,I wasn't. Let's get going!,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"No, not yet.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",8.3
S10E04,monica,What about your massage client?,8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",8.3
S10E04,joey,"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",8.3
S10E04,joey,I've been here the whole time!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!,8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.",8.3
S10E04,rachel,What?,8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!",8.3
S10E04,ross,"Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...",8.3
S10E04,rachel,"NO, no science camp!",8.3
S10E04,ross,Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!",8.3
S10E04,monica,Thanks!,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.",8.3
S10E04,chandler,"Let's do it, come on!",8.3
S10E04,ross,What's wrong? Are you okay?,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Hey, you made it into a bunny.",8.3
S10E04,joey,What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,Okay.,8.3
S10E04,ross,"Okay, you ready?",8.3
S10E04,rachel,Yeah.,8.3
S10E04,ross,A-a-and... record.,8.3
S10E04,rachel,"Okay.  Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...",8.3
S10E04,phoebe,"Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!",8.3
S10E05,rachel,"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.",8.2
S10E05,joey,Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!,8.2

S10E05,phoebe,"Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",8.2
S10E05,joey,Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.",8.2
S10E05,monica,You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!,8.2

S10E05,rachel,"Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Ok.,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Ok, let’s keep talking.",8.2

S10E05,phoebe,"Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!",8.2
S10E05,joey,"Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.",8.2
S10E05,chandler,I don’t... uh... understand.,8.2
S10E05,joey,Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?,8.2
S10E05,monica,It doesn’t make any sense.,8.2
S10E05,joey,Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!,8.2
S10E05,chandler,On every word?,8.2
S10E05,joey,Yep!,8.2
S10E05,monica,"Alright, what was this sentence originally?",8.2
S10E05,joey,"Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.",8.2
S10E05,chandler,And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,8.2
S10E05,joey,"Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.",8.2
S10E05,monica,"Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.",8.2
S10E05,joey,Why not?,8.2
S10E05,monica,"Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!",8.2
S10E05,chandler,"You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Amy, hi!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Oh, good for you!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,But Erin Brockovich had her own house.,8.2
S10E05,joey,"Ah, look who’s back!  Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?",8.2
S10E05,joey,What?,8.2
S10E05,joey,You slept out here?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’",8.2
S10E05,joey,"But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Joey, I can’t do that!",8.2
S10E05,joey,"Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  \Uoh oh oh",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.",8.2
S10E05,joey,'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.",8.2
S10E05,joey,"Yeah, Monica made us!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.",8.2
S10E05,joey,Yeaah.,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",8.2
S10E05,joey,"I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.,8.2
S10E05,chandler,I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.,8.2
S10E05,monica,"Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.",8.2
S10E05,ross,Seriously?,8.2
S10E05,chandler,Word!,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Well, mine was worse than that.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Well, what happened?",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Oh, that is so tacky.",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!",8.2
S10E05,monica,"Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Phoebe, that’s huge!",8.2
S10E05,ross,"Well, do you wanna marry him?",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",8.2
S10E05,chandler,She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?,8.2
S10E05,monica,"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",8.2
S10E05,monica,"I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...",8.2
S10E05,chandler,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",8.2
S10E05,monica,Thank you.,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Well, do you think I should propose?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,I think it could be kind of great!,8.2
S10E05,ross,Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",8.2
S10E05,monica,"How about at a game, on the big screen?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,NA,8.2
S10E05,monica,"What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?",8.2
S10E05,chandler,Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?",8.2
S10E05,ross,"No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Menstrual cramps.,8.2
S10E05,ross,I don't think that's what this is.,8.2
S10E05,rachel,Can any of you watch Emma?,8.2
S10E05,monica,"No, sorry sweety..",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..",8.2

S10E05,ross,"Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.",8.2

S10E05,ross,"Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!",8.2
S10E05,ross,"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Wha... the next one?,8.2
S10E05,ross,"Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!",8.2
S10E05,ross,I... I don't know..,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Absolutely.,8.2
S10E05,chandler,Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?,8.2
S10E05,joey,"Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.",8.2
S10E05,monica,You dropped it off?,8.2
S10E05,joey,Yeah.,8.2
S10E05,chandler,Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?,8.2
S10E05,joey,"No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.",8.2
S10E05,monica,You hand-wrote it?,8.2
S10E05,joey,"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!",8.2
S10E05,monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",8.2
S10E05,chandler,"It's ok, it's ok. You know what?",8.2
S10E05,monica,Okay good.,8.2
S10E05,chandler,.,8.2
S10E05,monica,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.",8.2
S10E05,chandler,They loved it.,8.2
S10E05,monica,What?,8.2
S10E05,chandler,They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.,8.2
S10E05,monica,They thought Joey was a child?,8.2
S10E05,chandler,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.",8.2
S10E05,monica,"Hey, what did you guys do today?",8.2
S10E05,chandler,That sounds like fun.,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Hey! Hi, how's my girl?",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Yeah!,8.2
S10E05,rachel,You pierced her ears!?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?,8.2
S10E05,chandler,I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Ugh.,8.2
S10E05,ross,Hey guys.,8.2
S10E05,ross,"Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Nah, I don't really want her to see.",8.2
S10E05,ross,Why not?,8.2
S10E05,monica,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,8.2
S10E05,chandler,Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,8.2
S10E05,ross,Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!,8.2
S10E05,ross,What?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,Nothing.,8.2
S10E05,ross,. Please tell me those are clip-ons.,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Oh, they're real!",8.2
S10E05,ross,Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"I know, I know, and you were right Ross.  You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!",8.2
S10E05,monica,"I'm a cool, fun aunt!",8.2
S10E05,chandler,Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!,8.2
S10E05,rachel,I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,Oh yeah? Since when?,8.2
S10E05,rachel,What?,8.2
S10E05,ross,That's not a thing!,8.2

S10E05,phoebe,"Well, I think you should wait.",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,That's not very enlightened!,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"Hey, hey!  Boo us? Boo you!",8.2
S10E05,joey,She was nice!,8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!",8.2

S10E05,rachel,"Oh, I can give you that.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,"Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.",8.2
S10E05,rachel,Did you just say Emma?,8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"It's in the cake, isn't it?",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,"What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!",8.2
S10E05,phoebe,Oh my God!,8.2

S10E06,ross,"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the \Paleontology Review\""! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there",8.2
S10E06,ross,Yeah. Why?,8.2
S10E06,ross,Your ex-boyfriend?,8.2

S10E06,monica,"Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?",8.2
S10E06,monica,"Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.,8.2
S10E06,monica,Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!,8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!",8.2
S10E06,monica,"Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"Why, you don't like her?",8.2
S10E06,monica,"Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,Really? You think?,8.2
S10E06,monica,"Absolutely! Yes, you say to him \I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.",8.2
S10E06,monica,"Damn it, I did not think this through!",8.2
S10E06,chandler,Hey you guys.,8.2

S10E06,joey,"What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?",8.2
S10E06,rachel,"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.",8.2
S10E06,chandler,Joe...,8.2
S10E06,joey,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!",8.2

S10E06,joey,Thank you.,8.2
S10E06,chandler,"Work, Joe!",8.2
S10E06,joey,Damn it!,8.2
S10E06,joey,Just pass it to your boss!,8.2
S10E06,chandler,"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!",8.2
S10E06,rachel,"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.",8.2
S10E06,chandler,"That's good! I liked it, they didn't. .",8.2
S10E06,ross,I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?,8.2
S10E06,ross,"Well, I... I am having a good hair day.",8.2
S10E06,ross,I'm ok.,8.2
S10E06,ross,"It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.",8.2
S10E06,ross,"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.",8.2
S10E06,ross,"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.",8.2

S10E06,monica,"Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!",8.2
S10E06,monica,"Wow, what's the bad news!",8.2
S10E06,rachel,Who's Gladys?,8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.",8.2
S10E06,rachel,"Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!",8.2
S10E06,phoebe,"Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!",8.2

S10E07,chandler,"That's funny, we were doing the same thing!",8.3
S10E07,ross,Yeah!,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!",8.3
S10E07,chandler,"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,So what did you two do about it?,8.3
S10E07,chandler,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",8.3
S10E07,ross,"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",8.3
S10E07,ross,"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!",8.3
S10E07,chandler,Maybe you do that next time you get married!,8.3
S10E07,ross,"No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!",8.3
S10E07,joey,Hey!,8.3
S10E07,chandler,Hey!,8.3
S10E07,joey,What's going on?,8.3
S10E07,chandler,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.,8.3
S10E07,monica,We?,8.3
S10E07,chandler,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!,8.3
S10E07,joey,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",8.3
S10E07,chandler,Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.,8.3
S10E07,monica,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",8.3
S10E07,joey,"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",8.3
S10E07,chandler,Little people?,8.3
S10E07,joey,Celebrity.,8.3
S10E07,monica,"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?",8.3
S10E07,chandler,What...? NO!,8.3
S10E07,monica,Chandler?,8.3
S10E07,chandler,"I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!",8.3
S10E07,monica,"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?",8.3
S10E07,chandler,"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",8.3
S10E07,monica,It isn't mine!,8.3
S10E07,joey,"Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,Mhm... it's moist.,8.3
S10E07,ross,Hi!,8.3
S10E07,rachel,Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!,8.3
S10E07,ross,"Oh, good!",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.",8.3
S10E07,rachel,Absolutely.,8.3
S10E07,ross,There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Oh my God, what!?",8.3
S10E07,ross,Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",8.3
S10E07,ross,Be-caaauuuse...,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.",8.3
S10E07,ross,Seriously?,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!",8.3
S10E07,ross,And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.",8.3
S10E07,rachel,All right!,8.3
S10E07,ross,"Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!",8.3
S10E07,monica,"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",8.3
S10E07,chandler,"Ok, ok, here we go.",8.3
S10E07,monica,Ok.,8.3
S10E07,chandler,Here we go. Stand up straight.,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Hello, is this the creepy residence?",8.3
S10E07,monica,"We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",8.3
S10E07,monica,I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",8.3
S10E07,monica,That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party.  All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",8.3
S10E07,monica,"That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,City Hall.,8.3
S10E07,monica,"Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding",8.3
S10E07,monica,Yay!,8.3
S10E07,chandler,But you already gave all your money to charity!,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Well, I’ll just ask for it back!",8.3
S10E07,chandler,I don’t think you can do that!,8.3
S10E07,monica,"Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!",8.3
S10E07,chandler,"That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Ok, careful.",8.3
S10E07,ross,Ok.,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Rach, she’s got like three hairs!",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"I know  but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.",8.3
S10E07,ross,I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.,8.3
S10E07,rachel,Ok.,8.3
S10E07,rachel,Ok.,8.3
S10E07,ross,Here we go!,8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!",8.3
S10E07,ross,"See, I told you!",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?",8.3
S10E07,ross,"Oh, absolutely!",8.3
S10E07,rachel,"Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.",8.3
S10E07,ross,Ok!  Ow!,8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",8.3
S10E07,phoebe,"Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.",8.3

S10E08,phoebe,Hey!,8.9
S10E08,ross,Are you kidding?,8.9
S10E08,chandler,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",8.9
S10E08,ross,That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!,8.9
S10E08,chandler,"No, no! We made this decision together.",8.9

S10E08,phoebe,"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.",8.9
S10E08,monica,"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",8.9

S10E08,monica,"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",8.9
S10E08,chandler,We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?,8.9

S10E08,phoebe,You're not making the pies yourself?,8.9

S10E08,phoebe,"Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.",8.9
S10E08,rachel,Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!,8.9

S10E08,rachel,"Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",8.9
S10E08,phoebe,Oh... okay.,8.9
S10E08,rachel,"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...",8.9
S10E08,rachel,And a thousand dollars.,8.9
S10E08,rachel,"...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...",8.9

S10E08,joey,"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",8.9
S10E08,chandler,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",8.9
S10E08,joey,"Dude, two times that happened!",8.9
S10E08,chandler,"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",8.9

S10E08,joey,"Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!",8.9
S10E08,chandler,Can you ever feel your ears?,8.9

S10E08,monica,"I do, but Rachel borrowed them.",8.9
S10E08,rachel,I lent them to Ross.,8.9
S10E08,ross,I gave them to Joey.,8.9
S10E08,joey,I left them at the park.,8.9
S10E08,monica,Oh!,8.9
S10E08,ross,I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.,8.9
S10E08,phoebe,I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.,8.9

S10E09,monica,"Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.",8.6
S10E09,joey,"I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!",8.6
S10E09,chandler,And so incorrect!,8.6
S10E09,monica,She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.,8.6
S10E09,ross,"Come on, she's gonna love you guys!",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.",8.6
S10E09,monica,And a lot could still get in our way.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,What are you gonna name the baby?,8.6
S10E09,chandler,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.,8.6
S10E09,joey,"But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?",8.6
S10E09,monica,Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!,8.6
S10E09,chandler,So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?,8.6
S10E09,monica,"You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Yes, but...",8.6
S10E09,monica,"Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and",8.6

S10E09,joey,"Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,Mandy.,8.6

S10E09,joey,"Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?",8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!",8.6
S10E09,joey,Growth!,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"Fine, I'll give you her number.",8.6

S10E09,ross,C'mon! This looks good!,8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.",8.6
S10E09,ross,Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?",8.6

S10E09,joey,Nope.,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,What are you talking about? Sarah's great!,8.6
S10E09,joey,"Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!",8.6
S10E09,joey,"Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,What?,8.6

S10E09,phoebe,"I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!",8.6
S10E09,joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,Oh,8.6
S10E09,rachel,Hi,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!,8.6
S10E09,rachel,what?,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...,8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Oh! Oh, no!",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,What? You know about the plate thing?,8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,You wouldn’t let her have a grape?,8.6
S10E09,rachel,Oh no! Not me! Emma!,8.6
S10E09,joey,JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!",8.6
S10E09,joey,What were we talking about?,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,This place is awesome!,8.6
S10E09,ross,"You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!",8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Ah, this place is great!",8.6
S10E09,phoebe,Wow!,8.6
S10E09,ross,"Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! .",8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!",8.6
S10E09,ross,. Three hundred and fifty dollars?,8.6

S10E09,ross,"All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.",8.6
S10E09,rachel,"No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...",8.6
S10E09,ross,"Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.",8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.",8.6
S10E09,ross,Really?,8.6
S10E09,rachel,"Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.",8.6
S10E09,ross,"So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?",8.6
S10E09,rachel,Why do men keep talking to me like this?,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?",8.6
S10E09,monica,Amen.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!,8.6
S10E09,monica,"Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.",8.6
S10E09,monica,It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Yeah, wow.",8.6
S10E09,monica,"Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.",8.6
S10E09,chandler,No-ot for me it doesn’t.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",8.6
S10E09,chandler,You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..,8.6
S10E09,monica,We don’t?,8.6
S10E09,monica,"Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Yeah, I did.",8.6
S10E09,monica,. You are SO going to Heaven!,8.6
S10E09,rachel,We got some really great stuff!,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.",8.6
S10E09,rachel,Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?",8.6
S10E09,rachel,Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by,8.6
S10E09,phoebe,"oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.",8.6
S10E09,ross,NA,8.6
S10E09,joey,I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!,8.6
S10E09,ross,Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.,8.6
S10E09,joey,"Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.",8.6
S10E09,ross,"Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?",8.6
S10E09,joey,Looks like someone IS the ladies!!,8.6
S10E09,ross,"You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  ALL eyes on ME!",8.6
S10E09,chandler,We are NOT signing those papers.,8.6
S10E09,monica,Why not?,8.6
S10E09,chandler,It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.,8.6
S10E09,monica,God works in mysterious ways.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,You have gotta stop!,8.6
S10E09,monica,But she liked us.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.,8.6
S10E09,monica,"Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Your Veal Chop is $34,95!",8.6
S10E09,monica,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",8.6
S10E09,chandler,But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?,8.6
S10E09,monica,Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,I know..,8.6
S10E09,monica,"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"oh, honey..",8.6
S10E09,monica,"Please.. please, we are so close.",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.",8.6
S10E09,monica,NA,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.",8.6
S10E09,monica,Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?,8.6
S10E09,chandler,You're Jewish.,8.6
S10E09,monica,Technicality!,8.6
S10E09,joey,"Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!",8.6
S10E09,joey,"oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.",8.6
S10E09,joey,"Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.",8.6
S10E09,joey,"How about those fries though, huh?",8.6
S10E09,joey,"You are beautiful, you know that?",8.6

S10E09,monica,I-Is... Is that a picture?,8.6
S10E09,monica,"Look, doctor!",8.6
S10E09,chandler,The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.",8.6
S10E09,monica,"Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.",8.6
S10E09,monica,"Well, we...  \bore false witness\""... See I could be a reverend.""",8.6
S10E09,monica,But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...,8.6
S10E09,monica,"Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...",8.6
S10E09,chandler,Erica wait!,8.6
S10E09,chandler,You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.,8.6
S10E09,chandler,"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",8.6
S10E09,chandler,"But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",8.6
S10E09,chandler,You still want that baby?,8.6

S10E10,phoebe,"Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!",8
S10E10,rachel,"Oh, that doesn't mean anything.",8
S10E10,phoebe,"Oh yeah? Well, let's see.",8

S10E10,chandler,It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.,8
S10E10,monica,Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?,8
S10E10,chandler,And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?,8

S10E10,monica,Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?,8

S10E10,joey,"Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!",8
S10E10,ross,"I know, and with the baby coming?",8
S10E10,phoebe,"So, should we tell her?",8
S10E10,ross,"I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?",8

S10E10,ross,"No one, I’m just saying if...",8

S10E10,ross,"I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!",8
S10E10,phoebe,"All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.",8
S10E10,ross,"Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...",8

S10E10,phoebe,"Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.",8
S10E10,ross,We think Chandler might be having an affair.,8
S10E10,monica,What?,8
S10E10,rachel,Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.,8
S10E10,phoebe,They went in together. So sorry.,8
S10E10,monica,Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?,8
S10E10,phoebe,What?,8

S10E10,monica,"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...",8
S10E10,chandler,Hey!,8
S10E10,joey,You son of a bitch!,8
S10E10,chandler,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?",8
S10E10,monica,Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.,8
S10E10,rachel,Who's Nancy?,8

S10E10,monica,"Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.",8
S10E10,chandler,Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.,8
S10E10,joey,I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!,8
S10E10,phoebe,Why do you have a realtor?,8
S10E10,monica,"Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.",8
S10E10,joey,What?,8
S10E10,rachel,Are you serious?,8
S10E10,monica,"When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.",8
S10E10,phoebe,So you're gonna move?,8
S10E10,ross,Oh my God.,8
S10E10,joey,Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!,8
S10E10,rachel,"What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!",8
S10E10,monica,"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",8
S10E10,chandler,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.,8
S10E10,ross,So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?,8
S10E10,phoebe,"Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",8
S10E10,ross,"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.",8
S10E10,joey,"No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!",8
S10E10,ross,", but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.",8
S10E10,chandler,"Actually, we already found a house we love.",8
S10E10,ross,What?,8
S10E10,monica,"And about an hour ago, we made an offer.",8
S10E10,chandler,"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?",8
S10E10,ross,You put an offer on a house?,8
S10E10,monica,NA,8
S10E10,phoebe,"Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?",8
S10E10,chandler,I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.,8
S10E10,joey,"Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  I really, really think I can!",8
S10E10,chandler,NA,8
S10E10,monica,"We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?",8
S10E10,rachel,Yeah it is.,8
S10E10,joey,What the hell are you doin'?,8
S10E10,phoebe,"Yeah, but so is this.",8
S10E10,ross,"Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?",8
S10E10,rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",8
S10E10,ross,You can see where he'd have trouble.,8
S10E10,rachel,Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.,8

S10E10,ross,"That money is mine, Green!",8
S10E10,rachel,"You're fly is open, Geller!",8

S10E10,phoebe,"[looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.",8
S10E10,rachel,"Ow, that had to hurt!",8
S10E10,phoebe,"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",8
S10E10,monica,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.",8

S10E10,monica,What the hell is that dog doing here?!,8
S10E10,chandler,"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",8

S10E10,ross,"You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.",8
S10E10,rachel,"Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.",8
S10E10,chandler,"Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.",8

Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",9

S10E12,monica,Ooh... she backed out.,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,She did? Why?,8.9

S10E12,monica,"Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!",8.9
S10E12,ross,I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.,8.9
S10E12,chandler,"I know, I hate being left out of things.",8.9
S10E12,ross,And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...,8.9

S10E12,joey,"Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?",8.9

S10E12,joey,"Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",8.9
S10E12,ross,"So, what did you decide?",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,I decided to pee.,8.9
S10E12,chandler,Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",8.9
S10E12,chandler,Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.",8.9

S10E12,phoebe,"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.",8.9
S10E12,ross,I'll do it!,8.9
S10E12,monica,"Ok, it's 2100 hours.",8.9
S10E12,monica,"You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!",8.9
S10E12,monica,NA,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.  but despite, you know... it got... it got good.

S10E12,joey,"Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!",8.9
S10E12,monica,"Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.",8.9
S10E12,monica,"Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Wow, this is a lot!",8.9
S10E12,monica,"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,You won awards?,8.9

S10E12,rachel,What d'you want?,8.9
S10E12,ross,"You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?",8.9
S10E12,rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",8.9
S10E12,ross,I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!,8.9
S10E12,rachel,"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",8.9
S10E12,ross,"Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!",8.9
S10E12,rachel,"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",8.9
S10E12,ross,"YES, YES!",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?,8.9
S10E12,monica,I know.,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \lorkins\"" what flowers would that be?""",8.9

S10E12,joey,"That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.",8.9
S10E12,joey,That was ME!,8.9
S10E12,rachel,Hi,8.9
S10E12,chandler,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",8.9
S10E12,rachel,"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.",8.9
S10E12,chandler,"Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.",8.9
S10E12,rachel,"All right fine, I pick you.",8.9
S10E12,chandler,"Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make \groom\"" for Chandler.""",8.9

S10E12,rachel,"Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,"Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",8.9
S10E12,monica,How's it going?,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,Help me.,8.9

S10E12,joey,"Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.",8.9
S10E12,ross,I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.,8.9
S10E12,phoebe,I know.,8.9
S10E12,rachel,"Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",8.9
S10E12,phoebe,What?,8.9
S10E12,rachel,"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!",8.9

S10E12,joey,"Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...",8.9
S10E12,ross,"Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.",8.9
S10E12,joey,"I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.",8.9
S10E12,monica,"Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.",8.9

S10E12,joey,"Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?",8.9

S10E13,monica,"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.",8.5

S10E13,rachel,"Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.",8.5

S10E13,ross,Thank you. I'm glad you agree.,8.5
S10E13,rachel,"It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.",8.5

S10E14,chandler,"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.",8.6

S10E14,phoebe,Good for you. That was really mature.,8.6
S10E14,joey,"What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.",8.6

S10E14,joey,I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!,8.6

S10E14,rachel,Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.,8.6
S10E14,rachel,But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.,8.6

S10E14,rachel,Hi... I'm on a date...,8.6

S10E14,rachel,"Okay. Oh, yeah...  Oh he's cute!",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.,8.6

S10E14,phoebe,"Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Well, not anything, I mean...",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Oh, this could take a while.",8.6

S10E14,phoebe,"Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.",8.6
S10E14,monica,"Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,That's what we were gonna name the baby.,8.6
S10E14,monica,Phoebe!,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,Uh! Princess Consuela.,8.6
S10E14,monica,You seriously changed your name to that?,8.6

S10E14,phoebe,"Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,"Hey, how'd the interview go?",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Oh! It's not good.,8.6
S10E14,chandler,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,That is a bad interview.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said \Wait a minute! Yes I am.\"" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.""",8.6
S10E14,monica,Oh God. I'm so sorry.,8.6
S10E14,ross,"Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,Ross...,8.6
S10E14,ross,I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!,8.6
S10E14,ross,"This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!",8.6

S10E14,chandler,Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!,8.6
S10E14,ross,"I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.",8.6
S10E14,ross,"Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.",8.6

S10E14,rachel,"Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!",8.6
S10E14,ross,And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.,8.6
S10E14,ross,But also knowing it means a lot.,8.6
S10E14,monica,But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.,8.6
S10E14,ross,...that center around work.,8.6
S10E14,chandler,To Ross!,8.6
S10E14,ross,You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,Oh God!,8.6
S10E14,ross,"No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.",8.6
S10E14,ross,"Rach, I'm so sorry.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Oh!,8.6
S10E14,ross,Great. I feel like an idiot.,8.6
S10E14,rachel,"No, it's okay, you didn't know.",8.6
S10E14,ross,Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.,8.6
S10E14,monica,Thank you for letting us see the house again.,8.6
S10E14,chandler,"And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.",8.6
S10E14,monica,"Ah, so glad you decided to come.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,What?,8.6
S10E14,joey,Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.,8.6
S10E14,monica,No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.,8.6
S10E14,joey,Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.,8.6
S10E14,monica,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,8.6
S10E14,joey,"Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.",8.6
S10E14,monica,No it's not!,8.6
S10E14,joey,Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!,8.6
S10E14,chandler,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.",8.6
S10E14,monica,"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...",8.6
S10E14,monica,"Joey, we know that's you.",8.6
S10E14,joey,no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm,8.6

S10E14,phoebe,"Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,Mike Crap Bag?,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"You're not serious, right?",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,And I love Crap.,8.6
S10E14,joey,Ow!,8.6
S10E14,joey,"Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?",8.6
S10E14,joey,Oh.,8.6
S10E14,joey,"I hate my friends.  Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?",8.6
S10E14,joey,"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Yeah, yeah, I guess.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Yeah, maybe.",8.6
S10E14,joey,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?",8.6
S10E14,joey,NA,8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Oh, thank you...",8.6
S10E14,rachel,NA,8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Ross, what is taking you so long?",8.6
S10E14,ross,"I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!",8.6
S10E14,rachel,NA,8.6
S10E14,rachel,I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?,8.6
S10E14,ross,"Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Oh, well,  you're not catching me on my best day.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Well, screw charity work. What've you got?",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Great! I'll call ya!,8.6
S10E14,ross,"Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Oh my God!,8.6
S10E14,ross,See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?,8.6
S10E14,rachel,Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.,8.6
S10E14,ross,That is Mark?,8.6
S10E14,rachel,Yes.,8.6
S10E14,ross,I hate that guy.,8.6
S10E14,rachel,Oh.,8.6
S10E14,ross,"No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,What? You don't want me to get a job?,8.6
S10E14,ross,"Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Ugh.,8.6
S10E14,ross,"I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Ross, you know what?",8.6
S10E14,monica,"Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,"Man, those two dogs are going at it!",8.6
S10E14,joey,Hey!,8.6
S10E14,chandler,Hey.,8.6
S10E14,monica,"Hey, where have you been?",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,Really? What changed your mind?,8.6
S10E14,joey,"Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,"Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.",8.6
S10E14,joey,What?,8.6
S10E14,chandler,Ha! I'm just messing with you.,8.6
S10E14,joey,That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!,8.6
S10E14,monica,"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?",8.6
S10E14,joey,What? I get my own room?,8.6
S10E14,chandler,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?,8.6
S10E14,joey,"Oh my God!  Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?",8.6
S10E14,joey,Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Thank you, mister Bag.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Oh hi Rita! Good!  Oh, Rita's a massage client.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Er, Rita, this is my husband.",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,Yeah.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,This is my husband Crap Bag.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,"Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?",8.6
S10E14,phoebe,How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,It's a funny word.,8.6
S10E14,phoebe,...Oh crap!,8.6
S10E14,ross,"Hey, is Rachel here?",8.6
S10E14,monica,No.,8.6
S10E14,ross,She's still at dinner?,8.6
S10E14,monica,I guess. Why? Who's she with?,8.6
S10E14,ross,That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.,8.6
S10E14,chandler,It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!,8.6
S10E14,ross,We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.,8.6
S10E14,monica,"So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.",8.6
S10E14,chandler,Excuse me?,8.6
S10E14,monica,Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.,8.6
S10E14,chandler,"For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.",8.6
S10E14,monica,"Oh, sorry!",8.6
S10E14,rachel,Hi you guys!,8.6
S10E14,ross,"Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?",8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.",8.6
S10E14,ross,Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?,8.6
S10E14,rachel,"Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.",8.6
S10E14,ross,Should we send something?,8.6
S10E14,chandler,How did the job stuff go?,8.6
S10E14,rachel,He offered me one.,8.6
S10E14,chandler,That's great!,8.6
S10E14,ross,Congratulations!,8.6
S10E14,rachel,"I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...",8.6
S10E14,ross,"Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.",8.6
S10E14,rachel,The job is in Paris.,8.6
S10E14,joey,"I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?",8.6
S10E14,joey,"Hey bear, I need some career advice.",8.6
S10E15,chandler,How did the job stuff go?,8.5
S10E15,rachel,He offered me one.,8.5
S10E15,ross,You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,The job is in Paris.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.",8.5
S10E15,ross,So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?,8.5
S10E15,chandler,Or facing a bitch of a commute.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.",8.5
S10E15,ross,Okay.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.,8.5
S10E15,ross,"All right, we'll work it out.",8.5
S10E15,rachel,Thank you! Thank you!,8.5
S10E15,ross,"Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?",8.5
S10E15,rachel,I think it is.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Ooh, what's going on?",8.5
S10E15,rachel,I got a really incredible job offer.,8.5
S10E15,joey,"Hey, great! All right!",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Good for you!,8.5
S10E15,rachel,It's in Paris.,8.5
S10E15,joey,"What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...",8.5
S10E15,monica,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...",8.5
S10E15,joey,"Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.",8.5
S10E15,rachel,"Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Of course we can. Congratulations.  Joey...,8.5
S10E15,joey,"No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.",8.5
S10E15,rachel,"Joey, it would mean so...",8.5
S10E15,joey,Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,Joey...,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,You okay with this?,8.5
S10E15,chandler,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but...",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Talking to Ross.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,I see.,8.5
S10E15,ross,"Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?",8.5
S10E15,monica,"I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.",8.5
S10E15,ross,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?",8.5
S10E15,monica,How is that gonna happen?,8.5
S10E15,chandler,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?,8.5
S10E15,ross,I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.,8.5
S10E15,monica,You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?,8.5
S10E15,ross,I didn't say we were brothers.,8.5
S10E15,monica,"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.",8.5
S10E15,monica,But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,8.5
S10E15,chandler,What do you think Pheebs?,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",8.5
S10E15,chandler,Yeah.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,She died.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,You're kidding!,8.5
S10E15,monica,That's terrible!,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,Oh yeah?,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Yeah, she was just an agent.",8.5
S10E15,monica,Joey's gonna be *so* upset.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.",8.5
S10E15,monica,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.",8.5
S10E15,monica,What if he reads it in the paper?,8.5
S10E15,chandler,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.",8.5
S10E15,ross,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.",8.5
S10E15,ross,Close. Ron.,8.5
S10E15,ross,"Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.",8.5
S10E15,ross,"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.",8.5
S10E15,ross,"Huh, I took a shot there.",8.5
S10E15,ross,I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?,8.5
S10E15,ross,"Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?",8.5
S10E15,ross,"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!",8.5
S10E15,ross,"You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.",8.5
S10E15,ross,"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.",8.5
S10E15,ross,He’ll be fine.,8.5
S10E15,joey,Hey Phoebe.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Hey. Everything ok?,8.5
S10E15,joey,I’m just mad at my agent.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Estelle? Why?,8.5
S10E15,joey,There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,I’m guessing she does.,8.5
S10E15,joey,"Well  I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",8.5
S10E15,joey,Ok. Why?,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.,8.5
S10E15,joey,I love that saying!,8.5
S10E15,joey,Hello?,8.5
S10E15,joey,I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.,8.5
S10E15,joey,"Yeah, actually I am!",8.5
S10E15,joey,"That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",8.5
S10E15,joey,"No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.",8.5
S10E15,joey,I’m saying that… .,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Man, tough week for Estelle!",8.5
S10E15,ross,Hi.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,Hi.,8.5
S10E15,ross,Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",8.5
S10E15,ross,Ok.,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",8.5
S10E15,ross,Nooo!,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.",8.5
S10E15,ross,"So, you’re not going to Paris.",8.5
S10E15,rachel,"No, I’m still going.",8.5
S10E15,ross,Wh… wh…what?,8.5
S10E15,rachel,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?",8.5
S10E15,ross,Yeeeah!,8.5
S10E15,monica,"Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.",8.5
S10E15,monica,Thanks.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,"It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?",8.5
S10E15,monica,"Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!",8.5
S10E15,monica,Love it!,8.5
S10E15,monica,"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?",8.5
S10E15,joey,"Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",8.5
S10E15,joey,"I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you",8.5
S10E15,joey,Why?,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.,8.5
S10E15,joey,You blow me away.,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?",8.5
S10E15,joey,"I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,And yet I never run into Beyonce!,8.5
S10E15,chandler,NA,8.5
S10E15,monica,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,Why!?,8.5
S10E15,monica,I don't know why.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,This can not be happening!,8.5
S10E15,monica,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.",8.5
S10E15,monica,All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?",8.5
S10E15,monica,"Okay, you come up with an idea.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.",8.5
S10E15,monica,But we love our house.,8.5
S10E15,chandler,"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  \Oh My God\""!""",8.5
S10E15,monica,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.",8.5
S10E15,chandler,NA,8.5
S10E15,ross,"Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.",8.5
S10E15,ross,Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?,8.5
S10E15,ross,Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  replica.,8.5
S10E15,ross,Huh? So? We have a deal?,8.5
S10E15,ross,Yes! yes!,8.5
S10E15,ross,"Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!",8.5
S10E15,ross,"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.",8.5
S10E15,joey,Oh my God.  Hello?,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,NA,8.5
S10E15,joey,Estelle?,8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.",8.5
S10E15,joey,"Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?",8.5
S10E15,phoebe,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...",8.5
S10E15,joey,"No, no, no!  Don't drop by, don't drop by!",8.5

S10E16,monica,Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.,8.9

S10E16,monica,"Come here, I'll make you a drink.",8.9
S10E16,ross,"Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?",8.9
S10E16,chandler,"I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!",8.9
S10E16,ross,Yeah?,8.9
S10E16,joey,"Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...",8.9

S10E16,ross,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?",8.9
S10E16,joey,"Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.",8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but I do have something for you.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Oh, oh. . What is this?",8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!",8.9
S10E16,monica,Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.,8.9

S10E16,monica,What are you talking about? These aren't mine.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!",8.9
S10E16,monica,"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.",8.9

S10E16,phoebe,She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.,8.9
S10E16,ross,Are you kidding? Oh my God...,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.",8.9
S10E16,ross,"Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...",8.9
S10E16,monica,I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.,8.9
S10E16,rachel,I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...,8.9
S10E16,monica,You're the best friend I ever had.,8.9

S10E16,monica,That is so sweet.,8.9
S10E16,ross,"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.",8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Uh, Rach?",8.9
S10E16,ross,Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.,8.9
S10E16,joey,I really made you think about that thing uh?,8.9
S10E16,chandler,NA,8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.",8.9
S10E16,chandler,"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...",8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.",8.9
S10E16,chandler,Pheebs!,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,Yeah!,8.9
S10E16,chandler,I think these are yours.,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,Can I talk to you alone for a minute?,8.9
S10E16,chandler,Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,Where do you think Mike really is?,8.9
S10E16,rachel,Oh honey...,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,NA,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,Okay. Oh...,8.9
S10E16,rachel,Oh!,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.",8.9
S10E16,monica,"So, I guess you're next. You're ready?",8.9
S10E16,ross,I don't think so.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.",8.9
S10E16,monica,You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.,8.9
S10E16,ross,God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.",8.9
S10E16,ross,"Okay, here we go...",8.9
S10E16,rachel,Oh...  Well...,8.9
S10E16,ross,Yeah...,8.9
S10E16,rachel,I think I'm gonna take off.,8.9

S10E16,rachel,"Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.",8.9
S10E16,ross,What? I don't get a goodbye?,8.9
S10E16,joey,Lucky bastard!,8.9
S10E16,ross,Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.,8.9
S10E16,monica,"Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.",8.9
S10E16,ross,"Well, it needs to be plicit.",8.9
S10E16,joey,"All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?",8.9
S10E16,ross,"No, I don't think so.",8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.",8.9
S10E16,monica,Yeah. Mine too.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,Mine was a humdinger,8.9
S10E16,ross,NA,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.",8.9
S10E16,monica,"And say what? \You owe me a goodbye\""",8.9
S10E16,ross,THE HELL I DO!,8.9
S10E16,ross,I don't get a goodbye?,8.9
S10E16,rachel,What?,8.9
S10E16,ross,"Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,Ross...,8.9
S10E16,ross,"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...",8.9
S10E16,monica,I hope Ross isn't too upset.,8.9
S10E16,joey,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.,8.9
S10E16,phoebe,Tell me about it.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.",8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"All right, I think I'm gonna head out.",8.9
S10E16,monica,"Uh, where do you think you're going?",8.9
S10E16,phoebe,"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.",8.9
S10E16,monica,We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.,8.9
S10E16,joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.",8.9
S10E16,monica,Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.,8.9
S10E16,chandler,NA,8.9
S10E16,monica,"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",8.9
S10E16,monica,"Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.",8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.",8.9
S10E16,monica,You did? How?,8.9
S10E16,chandler,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.",8.9
S10E16,monica,Oh my God! Let me see.,8.9
S10E16,joey,Who's that dirty old lady?,8.9
S10E16,chandler,Monica's grandmother.,8.9

S10E16,chandler,What?,8.9
S10E16,joey,"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.",8.9
S10E16,rachel,You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?,8.9
S10E16,ross,That's what it seemed like.,8.9
S10E16,rachel,"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.",8.9
S10E16,ross,"Fine, then why didn't you say something?",8.9
S10E16,rachel,"Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!",8.9
S10E16,ross,Rach!,8.9
S10E16,rachel,What?,8.9
S10E16,ross,"You keep, you keep... You can't...",8.9

S10E17,chandler,Oh my God!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.",9.5

S10E17,chandler,This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!,9.5
S10E17,monica,What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?,9.5

S10E17,chandler,Okay.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"So, ah... Any plans for the summer?",9.5

S10E17,chandler,"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.",9.5

S10E17,phoebe,I did not see that coming.,9.5

S10E17,phoebe,Yes.,9.5
S10E17,joey,Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.,9.5

S10E17,rachel,"Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.",9.5
S10E17,monica,"It's just a little bit more, honey.",9.5

S10E17,monica,We can't split them up!,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?",9.5
S10E17,chandler,What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?,9.5
S10E17,monica,"Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!",9.5
S10E17,monica,"That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of \Eight is Enough\"" comes out of there! We are taking them home",9.5
S10E17,chandler,Okay. Shhh...,9.5

S10E17,joey,You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?,9.5
S10E17,ross,What?,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.",9.5
S10E17,ross,You really think so?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  \Bam-bam",9.5

S10E17,joey,Hey!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.,9.5
S10E17,ross,Okay.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Ross, wait!",9.5
S10E17,ross,What? What?,9.5
S10E17,joey,Could you get me a muffin?,9.5
S10E17,rachel,Yeah?,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.",9.5

S10E17,ross,Oh my God!,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,Unbelievable!,9.5

S10E17,ross,I'm not getting you a muffin!,9.5
S10E17,monica,Do you think they recognize each other from in there?,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.",9.5
S10E17,monica,There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.,9.5

S10E17,phoebe,What?,9.5
S10E17,joey,Why not?,9.5
S10E17,ross,Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Uh, Joe?",9.5
S10E17,joey,Damn it!,9.5

S10E17,phoebe,"No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,Hey! What do you have there?,9.5
S10E17,ross,Oh my God! You did that yourself?,9.5

S10E17,joey,"You know, the baby can't read, Mike!",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.",9.5

S10E17,monica,"Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Aw, he's gonna be so happy.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? \Jack Bing",9.5

S10E17,phoebe,"Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,One? How about a whole bunch?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.",9.5
S10E17,monica,I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.,9.5

S10E17,phoebe,"So, you just let her go?",9.5
S10E17,ross,Yeah.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Hey, maybe that's for the best.",9.5
S10E17,ross,Yeah?,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,But now she'll never know how he feels!,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  Right?",9.5
S10E17,joey,Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.,9.5
S10E17,ross,"Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.",9.5
S10E17,joey,What?,9.5

S10E17,joey,"Good luck, good luck!",9.5
S10E17,ross,There's no seatbelt!,9.5

S10E17,ross,"Alright, alright, let's do this!",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,Okay!,9.5
S10E17,ross,Hey!,9.5

S10E17,joey,"Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Joey, wait! The ball!",9.5
S10E17,joey,Oh!,9.5
S10E17,joey,Oh God! So what do we do?,9.5
S10E17,chandler,I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.,9.5
S10E17,joey,Okay.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,No... It's all glued together.,9.5
S10E17,joey,Does that mean we have to bust it open?,9.5
S10E17,chandler,I don't know. Maybe.,9.5
S10E17,joey,Oh my God!,9.5
S10E17,chandler,I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. \Those are our men in there",9.5
S10E17,chandler,Did that movie ever get made?,9.5
S10E17,joey,It did not.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Ross, where are you going?",9.5
S10E17,ross,"To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?,9.5
S10E17,ross,Not since my cop-show got cancelled.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,You have to get a ticket to get past security.,9.5
S10E17,ross,What? We're never gonna make it!,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Oh.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Hey, I need a ticket.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,We're on our honeymoon.,9.5
S10E17,ross,I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,I'm so lucky I married you.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.,9.5
S10E17,ross,"Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"No, did we miss it?",9.5
S10E17,ross,"No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.,9.5
S10E17,monica,Hello.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"What? Hey, hey, listen..",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"That's alright. Listen, listen.",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?",9.5
S10E17,monica,Isn't that cute?,9.5
S10E17,ross,That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.,9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.",9.5
S10E17,monica,"That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.",9.5
S10E17,ross,What?,9.5
S10E17,monica,"Newark airport. Why, where are you?",9.5
S10E17,ross,JFK.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.",9.5
S10E17,joey,Okay. Here goes.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,What's the matter?,9.5
S10E17,joey,I need to say goodbye to the table first.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,I understand.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"I don't know. Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Okay, here we go. I can't do it.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Well, I can't do it either.",9.5
S10E17,monica,Hey! Did you find them?,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Well, I've never gone this fast before.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"She's got her cell, you could call her.",9.5
S10E17,ross,I am not doing this over the phone.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,You don't have any other choice!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,Hello?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Yeah.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.",9.5
S10E17,ross,Yay.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Uh, Rach, hang on.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Phoebe? Is everything okay?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,What? Why?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Well...,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Wait, what are you doing?",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Could I get some peanuts?,9.5
S10E17,rachel,This is ridiculous! I...,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Yeah, okay.",9.5
S10E17,monica,Alright. My job here is done.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,That was... Impressive.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Sorry about the table, man.",9.5
S10E17,joey,Yeah.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,You gonna buy a new one?,9.5
S10E17,joey,Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Well, at least we got these little guys out.",9.5
S10E17,joey,Yeah.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?",9.5
S10E17,joey,I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.",9.5
S10E17,joey,What?,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.",9.5
S10E17,joey,I could get a goose!,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?",9.5
S10E17,joey,"Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.",9.5
S10E17,ross,Where is she?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,I don't see her.,9.5
S10E17,ross,Rachel! Rachel Green!,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,There she is!,9.5
S10E17,ross,Rachel! Rachel!,9.5
S10E17,ross,"No, no, I just have to talk to someone.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"No, no, no, but...",9.5

S10E17,rachel,Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Okay, you're on.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Okay, the thing is..",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Yeah?,9.5
S10E17,ross,Don't go.,9.5

S10E17,ross,"Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,Oh my God.,9.5
S10E17,ross,"I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.",9.5

S10E17,ross,"No, you don't.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Yes, I do.",9.5

S10E17,ross,Rachel?,9.5
S10E17,rachel,I'm so sorry.,9.5
S10E17,ross,I really thought she'd stay.,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,I'm sorry.,9.5
S10E17,monica,"Well, that's it. Everything's packed.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Wow, this is weird.",9.5
S10E17,monica,I know.,9.5
S10E17,joey,"Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?",9.5
S10E17,monica,I put three lasagnas in your freezer.,9.5
S10E17,joey,I love you!,9.5
S10E17,joey,Hey!,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,Hey.,9.5
S10E17,joey,So did you guys make it in time?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,Where's Ross?,9.5
S10E17,phoebe,He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.",9.5
S10E17,ross,Oh my God!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,Excuse me?,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.",9.5
S10E17,ross,Let her off the plane!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!",9.5
S10E17,ross,Try to understand!,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...",9.5
S10E17,ross,No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?,9.5
S10E17,rachel,I got off the plane.,9.5
S10E17,ross,You got off the plane.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,I do love you.,9.5
S10E17,ross,"I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.",9.5
S10E17,ross,This is it. Unless we're on a break.,9.5
S10E17,ross,Don't make jokes now.,9.5
S10E17,monica,"Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.",9.5
S10E17,monica,"If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.",9.5
S10E17,ross,Wow.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,I know. It seems smaller somehow.,9.5
S10E17,joey,Has it always been purple?,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh, yeah, that's true.",9.5
S10E17,ross,"Uh, I haven't.",9.5
S10E17,monica,"Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?",9.5
S10E17,ross,Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?,9.5
S10E17,monica,"Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.",9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Oh, okay.",9.5
S10E17,phoebe,"So, I guess this is it.",9.5
S10E17,joey,Yeah. I guess so.,9.5
S10E17,monica,This is harder than I thought it would be.,9.5
S10E17,chandler,"Oh, it's gonna be okay.",9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?",9.5
S10E17,monica,We got some time.,9.5
S10E17,rachel,"Okay, should we get some coffee?",9.5
S10E17,chandler,Sure. Where?,9.5
