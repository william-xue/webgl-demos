## Visualization Design

The **table** compares the following attributes for each participating country: goals made and conceded, number of games lost, won, and played, and the result achieved (i.e., how far a team got before exiting) in the tournament. 
It also visualizes results for specific matches by allowing the user to expand and collapse all matches for a selected country. 

In addition, it visualizes the bracket for the second stage (the knockout phase) of the tournament in a **tree**. The tree and table are linked so that hovering over a team in the table highlights all the tree nodes and links for that team. Hovering over a specific match highlights only that game.
